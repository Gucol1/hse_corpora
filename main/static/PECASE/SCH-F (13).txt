hello everyone is pleasure be here and today I would like talk about resonation the nineteen sixties counterculture ideas the novel Narcissus and Goldman Herman Hesse begin with should say that Herman Hesse the German writer who did not have world wide recognition the beginning his path however the middle the twenty century the situation changed and his works suddenly gained popularity outside the German community (eh) particularly the United States and here wondered what was the reason for that so find out the answer for this question purpose the next hypothesis Hesse's works suddenly gained popularity the United States (eh) because there the most popular topics the nineteen sixties counterculture movement analysis defined what counterculture counterculture way life and set values which oppose the values the total society the nineteen sixties countercultural tendencies became endemic and the United States started just blowing from protests people expressed their disagreement with the mainstream values and united into movements concerning such issues racial segregation the American involvement into Vietnam war (eh) women`s discrimination all aspects life all the terms behaviour related sexuality and sexual relationships and finally deterioration environmental conditions and its negative impact humanity ... (eh) reading Hesse's novel Narcissus and Goldman that was written nineteen thirty you can see its brief summary the slide (em) were may come cross the some aspects that were not typical for society the time that (eh) the time when book was written (eh) some aspects that later become highly relevant for the sixty generation and (eh) the first aspect that would like talk about deep connection with the environment Goldman's harmony with nature the novel is absolutely doubtless wondering and forests countrysides shows interest and plants and trees and empathy towards killed animals his mind nature the life origin it where is trying find himself very similarly hippies members the nineteen sixties counterculture who led back nature lifestyle the environment becomes significant part Goldman part misses and comes back through the home novel and leads to the next aspect Goldman becomes man nature land animal instincts becomes the seducer who never loses the opportunity spend time with the woman and during his dease wondering meets many women and all them are seen (eh) just part his experience they only have him shape the image the universal mother that believes them (eh) thus understand that the novel sexual experiences are seen something enreaching rather than something sinful and reason music the nineteen sixty very much because was the sixties counterculture that turned the concepts family relationships upside-down and let normalisation such things promiscuity parental sexual relationships and others (eh) now let's address the aspect related the sexual liberation movement is homosexuality although Goldman experiences his life the arms fashioned women does not actual love any them (eh) only loves the joy and passion that them bring him the least physical but the most enduring and powerful kind love can active Goldman with Narcissus and they may difficult perceive love beyond physical is clear that connection between the two men not just friendship brief acquaintance both men expressed their love each other openly and their relationship definitely example new morals (eh) that the generation the sixties establish ... (eh) the last aspect would like talk about today antisemitism Goldman ones met Rebekka Jewish girl who get all got completely burning down because Jews have been accused the cause the and Goldman carries her story throughout his whole life eraser image and can understand that historian being victim persecutions made great impression him Goldman feels sorry for the Jewish community that God (eh) mistakenly blamed and violently attacked for the outbreaks for the black death which the way somebody does not know actually happened Europe the middle the fourteen century antisemitism generally considered form racism we made draw parallel between Jews and black people the middle the twentieth century practical society division who guard treated badly only due their urgent so Narcissus and Goldman well other works Herman Hesse brings out the things sexuality protection the environment and opposition any kind violence the world people the nineteen sixties could definitely find the novel reflection the values that the establish (eh) and those the example this novel suddenly have proved our hypothesis (eh) that the popularity rises Hesse's works the middle twenty century the United States may explained the fact that the master managed perceive the future and (eh) mirror (em) the values the topics that lately become became extremely relevant for people and the last thing would like quickly point out that the events the sixties gave foundation (eh) for the moral system modern people and that's why not only it intriguing and captivating explore the social change over time but is also very important we must should know the origin our character and reading Hesse's books great opportunity do that do that and get amazed the social political importance (eh) his works had the United States for the sixties and seventies generation thank you very much for your attention and you have any questions feel free ask them

thank you very much any question I feel uncomfortable because my curiosity you use very interesting metaphor in your title resonating yeah let's say. there`s some resonance between Hesse and nineteen sixties can you explain by using some other words and maybe terms what you imply resonance

maybe reflection is not clear the thing that (eh) Hesse's works Hesse himself (em) wrote before the sixties counterculture and couldn't point out the right way that human issued foresee the events the future events that his works (eh) were influenced the counterculture movement

yeah okay was not influenced that because that would anachronism well (eh) ... again that foresaw the hippie movement for example

he did not foresee the movement itself and all the movements but (eh) he could perceive could predict (eh) the things that people would interested that would highly relevant for people the future

why not sure about that is reflecting something that was before him

that the thing just thought that the word resonation (eh) would quite clear that

what that explanation was writing the book experienced something which brought the past

no that not what mean

I mean that would an easy explanation then telling something that foresaw some trends the future would be easy explanation

I guess so

what mean you list factors environment promiscuity homosexuality and antisemitism you know where find the same list the literature the bring from the nineteenth twentieth century for example writers similar Oscar Wilde you know where also find that the European romanticism the beginning the nineteenth century nature promiscuity homosexuality antisemitism this the list that saw much earlier than Hesse maybe should look him this way experienced and influenced from the past

nineteen that these aspects (eh) are earlier used Hesse is obviously that can see can meet this aspect the works other writers (eh) but the thing was wanted prove the hypothesis that his works became (em) popular because there this various topics

well that mean should that the point that should proven what people like becomes popular ... and anything from the past can become popular Aristotle become popular from become popular some period

yeah sure but was interesting have look what writer could what topics writer could raise (eh) the time when was not maybe suitable see so

in just another fact just fact giving you (eh) Hesse became popular the Soviet Union the eighties the nineteen eighties when there was talk about promiscuity there rigid moral standards nothing about homosexuality definitely there was official antisemitism and the society was turning actually technological the eighties all the facts again contradict what you single out but Hesse did become popular that time that`s mystery why then just fact

thank you for understand you right you are saying that Hesse gained popularity America nineteen sixties and you are thinking that had something do with this resonance between his ideas and between what was going in the culture America the time

yeah that what thought

right (em) question wouldn't you want look the history publication and reception Hesse's work the USA that time you want prove that this resonance existed we stay this round ideas just probably just like saying lot ideas they don't really belong particularly time culture is (em) not like imagine exercise but you look the you know not know the publishing houses that shows that made the decision publish particular novels Hesse (eh) what made them come this decision because pretty sure it's documented how these novels were received the public what the reviewers these novels looked and highlighted significant issues not know the novels well you look that aspect then you might actually prove that this moment history nineteen sixties you know the USA the novels Hesse became interesting for those reasons that you are pointing out you know would think the way go look what was going in the publisher's and the reader's hands well to look the (em) the novel itself not maybe much question suggestion


thank you very much I`ll take that into consideration 

and that would probably good do under basis also comparison with some other maybe German writers the same period yeah mean he really favourite maybe some writers where more popular than yeah again what the point seizing yes you should look the issues the novels how much was published during particular period how many them published 

 may ask question 

 sure course I didn`t expect that you are welcome 

 yeah I think that your previous questions were more about the past but more interested the present (eh) what you think as you mentioned yes the topics homosexuality and you read Steppe Wolf guess that would in translation is just not mistaken is something about transsexuals transgenders not really remember you think that now these topics would maybe understood from point view that Hesse actually pretty homophobic transphobic what you think about these like his ideas and was pretty progressive for his time but what about our time

 think is kind weird (em) consider (em) writers from long ago homophobic transphobic anything else because lived other time and such things like were not relevant the time yet was not written (eh) with the aim (eh) I not know say something bad about somebody else do not think would (em) proper say such things about (eh) writers like Herman Hesse thank you
