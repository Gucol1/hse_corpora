Yes can believe (em) hello dear colleagues name and I'm ready present you research the international legal status information warfare and information weapons the relevance (erm) the topic due the development the information technology and the information communications and other devices these resources are ccomparable cause damage (erm) comparable the consequences (em) the open military conflict (erm) the concept information warfare began develop after the cold war and became (eh) became wildly used (em) after the operation Desert Storm (erm) that placed Iraq nineteen ninety one but the key question here what information warfare (em) unfortunately nowadays there only one legal definition that current (eh) and is not international (erm) definition is national defi (em) definition (eh) is placed the United States and (eh) is defined that informational warfare actions taken achieve (eh) information superiority supporting the national military strategy influencing (em) the enemy's information and information systems (em) apart from there one more definition (eh) is (eh) Convention Ensuring (eh) International Information Security (eh) two thousand eleven but (eh) the status this convention not current because the United Nation hasn't decides(eh) anything about (em) apply not apply (eh) this convention and information warfare there confrontation between two more states (eh) the information space order damage information system (eh) also damage political financial and public systems also the society systems as can see the range actions (eh) connected with the informational warfare according this (eh) conventions extremely wide (eh) and can (eh) count almost all (eh) actions (eh) the informational space (eh) the informational warfare my opinion is wrong and is also wrong interpret informational warfare an independent institute international (eh) law but the category (eh) information weapon should defined informational weapon also (eh) space a legal space international law it doesn't exist (erm) definition new institute international law (eh) but my opinion (eh) need have (erm) and now will explain you why (eh) according the article one the General Assembly Resolution (em) aggression defined the use armed force state against (eh) the territory (eh) territorial independency (erm) and on (eh) we can see (eh) cannot (eh) count that (eh) informational weapon here (eh) an aggression because (eh) the mandatory element here .(eh) armed force but informational weapon (eh) not associated with the armed force (eh) although according article four the same (eh) resolution (eh) provides that the above list acts not exhaustive and the Security Council (eh) may determine that other acts constitute aggression under the provisions the Charter and also the paragraph one article five (erm) says that considerations any nature they political economic military otherwise may justify aggression. according the (eh) article five and four can have (eh) new category weapon international law (erm) but there are (mm) some legal problems create new category the weapon for example (erm) according. the (eh) Additional Protocol the Geneva Conventions (eh) article thirty six (eh) proposing (eh) creating new types weapon (eh) doesn't have some (eh) criteria (eh) creating new type weapon but (eh) according the section one part three this convention (eh) viruses logic bombs and other means special software (eh)  (em) specified (eh) forbidden for the warfare that's why (eh) means that is also about the (mm) informational weapon the mean like this (eh) (eh) for the new category proposed have the elements and the features the informational (eh) weapon and the first one (eh) secrecy secrecy an element (eh) manifested (eh) special (erm) hiding subject and the hiding (eh) actions the subject it's very difficult (eh) calculate and find out the actions the subject the (mm) informational weapon the second one extent it connected with the spread large territory and also the consequences the using weapon and the last one universality it's all is the ability choose the subject the methods and also there are some features the weapon the first one (eh) an intention can direct indirect and the second one (eh) negative consequences (eh) using this weapon (erm) according (mm) what said (em) (eh) can say that (eh) is (eh) definition an informational weapon informational weapon (eh) ways and means that are aimed interfering the informational system and violating (eh) information security the state (eh) the society and the human rights (eh) concrete state (eh) it also needed say that there are two types informational warfare (eh) the first one (eh) active informational warfare and (eh) the second one psychological informational warfare active informational warfare connected with the defeatss (eh) informational system the military actions and also (eh) with the aim (eh) with the aim (eh) enemy object (eh) the state (eh) and the slide you can see some examples the active informational warfares psychological informational warfare connected with the impact the people's psyche (eh) has false character and (eh) the progress this (erm) weapon (eh) destabilised (eh) society (eh) one two more states (eh) can visual sound holographic ethical manipulation and on now want you (mm) have some examples these (em) weapons the first one the example (mm) active informational weapon (eh) it's the virus love you it's placed (eh) two thousand and (eh) the virus has attacked (eh) more than two thousand users computers and has enormous harm and damage the personal computers state department for example two Ford company computers and Pentagon personal computers and the total damage (em) this virus was ten billion dollars (em) the second example (eh) the second example (eh) the psychological (mm) weapon (eh) the situation connected with COVID-19 pandemic (em) the situation (eh) was connected with the spreading (eh) face sorry fake news about the COVID-19 (eh) pandemic april (eh) may two thousand twenty the main false idea was connected with the (em) with .the that virus was biological weapon created the Chinese authorities and created artificially regulate the world pupi population initially this news (mm) was published The Washington Times (eh) the media (eh) but spread rapidly and literally one mig later the whole world (erm) was covered these news (eh) also (mm) took place Russia (eh) and (eh) after that had (eh) new (mm) article (eh) the court administrati (eh) administrative offenses connected with (eh) (mm) spreading fake news about the COVID-19 (eh) such information falls under the category psychological information weapon (eh) because many people suffered (eh) result its dissemination (eh) (eh) the percentage nervous diseases increased panic and the harassment China began (erm). the second example psychological weapon (eh) can say that it's image (eh) Jesus Christ was (eh) holographic picture the sky (eh) and occurred February nineteen ninety three after the end (eh) the war persian territory and during the sandstorm the area Mogadishu (eh) the image Jesus Christ appeared the sky and there was (eh). there was some soldiers and (eh) they said was not just familiar face but was the image Jesus Christ it usually given religious publications paintings and sculptures around the world the image (eh) was kept the sky for five minutes and caused (eh) deep shock among all the soldiers the image actually was a holographic (em) picture and aimed (eh) from heaven call the (eh) fellow believers stop resistance (erm) ..so the of course should liability for the countries that use (eh) (mmm) the informational weapon and (eh) the liability for the countries (eh) lie under the chapter one article two part four the Charter not use (eh) threaten (eh) and forbidden  (eh) territorial integrity political independence any State and (eh) is also article two the (eh) N (eh) General Assembly (eh) using the (em) informational weapon my opinion an internationally illegal act (em) and (eh) the end (eh) can say that (mm) (eh) informational weapon causes many problems and need solve this problems course the first (eh) way solve (eh) the problem connected with the regulating (eh) the new (eh) the new category legal regulation course prevent these (em) damages (eh) actions need have legal regulation the informational weapon (eh) the next way to. solve (eh) the the problem to establish (eh) international ingovernmental (eh) ingovernmental organisation (eh) specializing (eh) (eh) control (eh) non (eh) proliferation information weapons for example an organisation controlling (eh) (eh) spreading nuclear nuclear weapon (eh) this (eh) organisation should based the (eh) agreement non (eh) proliferation information weapons and will (eh) ensure legal ban using informational systems for military purposes and (eh) the key point this agreement and this organisation not create and impart information weapons technology their cration finally should say that information weapon must controlled because (eh) false information can cause
