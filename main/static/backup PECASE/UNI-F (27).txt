hello. everybody.. let me introduce myself.  I'm really (erm) it's it's  pleasure to  today. (er) my name is.  I'm a first year (er) student. of economics. in Higher School of Economics (er) today. I'll be talking about. youth migration. (erm) (eh) nowadays. it's really relevant. and for this (er) question. for young. adults. to  something big (er) to (erm) to take a significant place in their life. and to get (er) your job (er) because it's vital. your job.. (er) that's why. my objective. (erm) my objective and research question (er) for today. is (er) is to. (er) examine young adults motivation to  to other city (er) in Russia. in Russia. or. move abroad... today. the stress of my presentation. (er) is the following. (er) we have (er)  of (er) I divide my presentation. into four parts. (er) first. as you can see (er) I will talk to you about the previous research. (er) that dealt with this problem.. (er) the second. I'll give you. (er) presentation  the methodology. (er) of my study.. third. I will talk you about. the. results of that I have received. and. finally. I'll put some conclusions.. to start with. I just want to talk you about (er) the interesting story about girls. about girl. (er) she's from. Perm.. (er) she has graduated (er) Moscow. State. University. of International. Rela=. of International Relationship. then she. moved to. USA.. there she was. as working. IT (erm)  company.. that two years. but now she back to. return back to.. Perm. and work in. for this company..
well (er) how do you like  education and free .. I think it's. it's absolutely amazing.. (er) now. let me. (er)... it will be closer to my topic. (er) let me first give you a brief overview. of. of the latest research results. over the past years. the. interests. of this problem. has been due to the fact. that.. ya= youth immigration. big insights into.. deep insights. into motivation of young adults. as well. as the attractiveness (er) of some. regions in Russia. and. some fields of education.. (er) as you can see (er) there is three main points. that. focuses (er) which are focuses. on the. youth migration.. the first. is the search (er) for the main trends of migration. that is the structural characteristics of different age groups. and second is young adults attitudes. (er) migrating. migration and. .. all the place where they will live. all this things is concerned with the one big point that. it list to the. (er) (er) that person.. will have a good (er) career and success in real life.. (er) well. next. I'll be talking about. the theoretical background. (erm) (mm) I've learned lot of articles. that most of them. and the most recent of them.   only a three of them.. the first is the .. (er) they were talking about. the regional migration patterns. (erm)... It's (er).. sorry.. (er) (er) (er) immigration patterns of young adults. at the age of. sixteen to twenty four. (er) in England and Wales.. one the  findings is that. is.. is.  of our population change.. the following (er) articles. that I learned. it. was.. the opposite. these articles were . and. totally. they. have. (er) founded. about. the. universities. which had really.. (er) which have the. regionally. recognised.  programs. (er) and. they were setting the. age. of students. abou= about. (er) from seventeen to twenty four.. they.. (erh) and these kind of universities. (er) have greater opportunity. and ability to. attract more residents students.. also. they establish the. linkage between. nonresident students. and the environment economic.. and the last (er) articles (eh) it was about (er) migration . the aruthors are .
(er) they were talking about. the integration  (er)... and (eh) compared immigration attractiveness. of Russian regions.. (er) according to the... one minute left... well (er) I just want to tell you about that. the ranking of regions. really interesting. and Perm Krai is. twentieth. not on the last point. not on the last position but.. in the second part of the. ranking.. and (er) if this area. if the regions have. a lot of.. (er) a lot of cities. which have (er) (eh) plus... million plus (er). population. is of course they have more ability and opportunities. to be on the top of the range..
and (er) the students of these cities. have more. (eh) opportunities. to go to. (em) another citites. like Mosc=  like Moscow. Saint-Petersburg. and. to get a job there. and. to. (mm) of course. personally. we are educated. well in the. this cities.. well. let me introduce. my research.. design. (erm) I've. I've mad=
made the conclusions 
ok.. ok.. conclusions.. (er)... first of all. (er) students (er)  the. the poll in Perm. and of course. it were.  eighty students of the first year course of economic (eh) eighty percent of them. wanted to leave Perm of course. and. about. (er) twenty percent. they don't want to leave. and they want to stay in Perm. (er) most of them were. female. girls. (er) because maybe they're closer to family or. I don't know.. and (er) the  conclusion. you can see on the slide . work options are limited in Perm. and of course. it's required to improve the regional system of high education and provide. (er) some socio-economic incentives.. thank you for your attention..

well. just actually (er) there's a lot of I've. founded. new. from my research. because. partly for me. it's. it's really. important to.. to get (erm) to take a significant place in my life. and be. to have. to become a successful person. and. I suppose that. in. (er) little cities. of course. our city. Perm. I mean. we have plus more. (er) population. like more than one million (er) we can develop. ourselves. in some spheres. but not... a lot of people. who are interested in digital technologies. and. in our city. as example. there is not so many. directions I guess.. yes. there are. maybe Morion. and other things. is really cool things. but. if you want to go. several steps. and (er) take some. top positions. of course. you will have to move to another. point.. and. I= I= I= I just really don't know. there's nothing interesting. there's nothing new sorry in this research. no just because I kney that. a lot of people. who want to move to another. city.. Perm. Moscow. Saint-Petersburg. maybe.. Sochi. and others. which are really developed. and
there is something new at methodology
but methodology.. (er) I= I just. my methodology include just  poll.. I. started. into the. social networks. Vkontakte. this poll. (er) to all the students that are on the first year course. and. they just. put a sign (er) (mm) do they want to leave (erh) the city. the Perm just. the poll. is my. it was my methodology... the what
data analysis
