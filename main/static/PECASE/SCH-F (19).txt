 good afternoon dear speakers and the panel I'm and I'm student 10 grade and today would like present research paper devoted evaluation absorption capacity entorosorbents different structures why? yes (um) right yes (um) this particular group drugs being chosen for study (um) statistics reports about two hundred sixty cases domestic poisoning (uh) per one hundred thousand people year Russia and about about quarter which does not survive one the main first measures for poisoning in the entorosorbents and the sorbents presented the pharmaceutical market large assortment names the right price range (uh) they have different absorption capacity and accordingly different therapeutic effectiveness this regard. is important compare the absorption capacity enterosorbents presented the pharmaceutical market (uh) our city Petrozavodsk the purpose our research work was evaluate the absorption capacity enterosorbents other structures hypothesis the absorption capacity activated carbon is not lower than the absorption capacity enterosorbents higher price category tasks research and what enterosorbtion and what the sorption process enterosopbtion method based the finding and eliminating where's toxic substances from the gastrointestinal drugs for therapeutic preventive purposes and sorption the process collecting molecules gases vapours solutions the surface solid liquid substance the body the surface which sorption occurs called absorbent and absorbed substance called absorbate (uh) the effects drugs the ability bind poisons directly from the lumen digestive organs well to suppress weaken toxic allergic and inflammatory processes lot detoxification and excretion organs the chemical structures (um) sorbents can divided into charcoal sorbents, sorbents based natural and synthetic resins synthetic polymers and non digestible liquids silicon containing sorbents natural organic sorbents based dietary fiber green pectins and and combined preparations containing two more types above mentioned sorbents. enterosorption used medicine for the treatment wide range acute and chronic diseases are campaigned toxicologists the the advantage uh enterosrption are the rapid binding the toxic the gastrointestinal drugs reducing the resorption the poison (uh) it's disadvantage consist local contact with the toxicant resorption the toxicants the H gradient the medium a negative effect the the gastrointestinal tract and the possibility abrorption useful substances (uh) the efficiency use the use (uh) enterosorbents also depends its absorption capacity we conducted experiment compare their absorption proprieties enterosorbents different structures (uh) took samples enterosorbents different chemical structures and belonging different price categories which corresponded single dose per adult these are well known Smekta Polisorb Filtrum and charcoal they were placed glass flasks and mixed (um) with one hundred milliliters solution phenolic red (uh) first stirred the solution for five minutes and then for fifteen more minutes during this time the color the solution gradually changed which indicated decrease the concentration the dye the (uh) solution due its abrorption (um) determine the initial and residual concentration the absorbate. used the method spectrophotometry which based the measurement spectra the optical region electromagnetic radiation according the results the experiment (um) compiled comparative table based the data which came the conclusion (uh) that charcoal has the highest suction capacity while Polisorb possesses the lowest one however charcoal sorbents can traumatic for membranes digestive organs (uh) in case erosive and gastrointestinal tract is better you Smekta Polis- (uh) Philtrum-C that not injure them mucous membranes the digestive organs (uh) conclusion would like note that our hypothesis was confirmed the course study all the studied enterosorbents are different their absorption capacity but did not depend the chemical structure chemical composition the drug the price category drug the clinical effectiveness often the enterosorbents affected their adsorption capacity well the presence absence side effects additional properities and the ability bind (uh) microorganisms and heavy metals (uh) since enterosorbents are often used or prescribed people with poisoning is important know the factors (uh) responsible for the quality and effectiveness drug order be able choose the appropriate (uh) drug therefore hope that the information that provided today will useful for you the future and thank you all for your attention. 
so far well you've just analyzed only these well (um) drugs this medicines yes you've just may introduced and presented here the through your presentation but (uh) why have you chosen only these (uh) medicines these drugs and then maybe one more question just follow this one (uh) well would you like continue and investigating maybe (uh) and adding some more samples?
 thank you for the question and yes (uh) this (uh) adsorbents was chosen (uh) were chosen because (um) people used (uh) very often (uh) is popular adsorbents and (uh) adsorbents presented the pharmaceutical market largest names and (um) yes will continue research work because is very interesting topic for and think will more more (um) decisions this topic and (um) contribution more contribution (um) the future
