 we're continuing the linguistic (eh) trend can you see the screen (eh) not it's yeah yeah can right ... (eh) good afternoon everybody (eh) name am from Chaikovskii and would like present you research the British dialects (eh) an introduction would like say that English language international and today every modern person needs know least the basics it but English different everywhere especially concerns Great Britain where you will pass your dialect every twenty kilometers and sometimes (eh) people from different parts Britain can barely understand each other say nothing the students who different audio tasks school (eh) you know these tasks are voiced people speaking different accents (eh) that's why sometimes (eh) struggle much and thought would useful (eh) just compare the dialects find the similarities differences and specificities just develop our listening skills and make that audio tasks easier for so goal was study and compare several British dialects (eh) research included several parts they were studying the concept dialect .studying the history British dialects and then made research several (eh) particular dialects that I've chosen (eh) you can see thier names (eh) here (eh) also you can see the map (eh) when you can see the area the distribution (eh) for instance there are cockney, Cornwall and others that I've chosen what dialect the dialect form language that people speak some particular region and (eh) this form has its own (eh) grammar vocabulary and other specificities which sometimes can cause the troubles understanding them. British dialects can divided into northern central southern eastern and western and is estimated that there are about fifty dialects Great Britain but also have say that there are little differences even different towns ... (eh) when was studying (eh) was completing the table (eh) where . compared the area with distribution some phonetic and lexical specificities you can see part my table here (em) just wrote the main features that could find (eh) obviously cannot tell you about each the dialects and would like tell you about Cockney Cockney dialects spoken central areas London (eh) the word Cockney can translated cock's eggs (em) this term was used (em) name .some underdeveloped eggs people who lived villages London use that word call (em) the city workers who did not know the customs the village and that's why Cockney used consider be many people even consider to (eh) some sort landmark London just like double decker buses for the main features Cockney (em) they replace with (em) they often use ain't instead am not not and are not just like (em) unintelligent Americans (erm) for some phonetic features Cockney distorts many sounds (er) they pronounce as also often (em) so they say for instance love instead love (eh) and sometimes they skip sound the beginning words the got 'orrible instead horrible but the main and the most famous specificity Cockney the rhyming slang (eh) they replace some parts their speech with some words from idioms (em) for example phone rhymes with dog and bone they might say wait second dog's ringing meaning phone ringing they say (eh) I've run out bees and honey meaning money because money and honey just rythm was also very interesting me how well classmates know and understand different British dialects that's why conducted experiment trying figure that out there were fifteen participants (em) this number not really big but have say that many people refused take part the experiment because wasn't just quick simple survey was something bigger and asked them they already know some British dialects than gave them video for each the dialects and asks them write down some particular words gave them sentences with gaps and they had fill the gaps and then asked share their impressions and here are some screens from the videos that showed them here are the results (em) turns out that half my classmates did not know any British dialects and half them already did which was which was quite quite surprising me because before doing the research did not know any (em) so here's the level understanding those Southern dialects according my experiment you can see the exact percentage here (em) turned out that Yorkshire was the most challenging one understand (em) and the also known Standard English was the easiest one for the majority participants (eh) I've made several conclusions first all (eh) the dialective differences England are much more pronounced than Russia Russia the maximum differences that can possibly is like different pronunciation some vowels but English you can sometimes barely catch word (em) also turned out that British dialects have many common features (em) as for the problem that have identified turned out that lot people really face so they struggle understanding people from different parts the country (eh) that's why. think table would really useful for them just find out some main differences (em) and should also say that studying dialects .is very interesting and fascinating and (em) I'm planning continue doing that research higher level that was all thank you for your attention thank you (em) any questions ... ... right yeah thank you for your paper can take look the bar chart one more time (em) could you please repeat just didn't catch this yeah it's probably connection can see the slide with the bar chart (em) this one yes this one .so. what what these figures mean (eh) you're saying that Yorkshire corresponds twenty seven percent could you please tell what means twenty seven percent what twenty seven percent understanding and just didn't include the explanation my (em) presentation because would take much time but now can explain so. have already said gave classmates text with some gaps and this text was just (eh) what was said the videos and asked classmates fill the gaps there were three gaps each the dialogues each the videos and there were fifteen participants it makes (em) forty five possibly correct answers and just counted the number correct answers for instance got twenty two and just twenty two forty five gives about forty five percent that's how counted and (eh) think it's better than just (eh) subjective level right yeah thank you so.. what the importance these figures now that you know that among the people with whom you talked well certain dialects yield better understanding than the others why does matter in what way does does matter well doesn't really matter just wanted show that some people struggle understanding different dialects that's why need like share this issue (em) and was just something that was interesting know thank you see thanks I also got probably couple questions what was the principal (eh) your choosing these particular seven dialects are you sure that you haven't left some one couple them important out well (eh) actually have admit that had say England instead Great Britain because they didn't really take Welsh Irish I'm sorry for that and like I've chosen the dialects had like little amount common features just show that are extremely different from each other (eh) couple them were also suggested me my teacher Yorkshire and Cornish she said that this accent was the most challenging one for the majority people and was just interesting for to find out what was special about them that sounds bit voluntaristic and random in case you're doing the research and would like continue that topic you say probably needs some kind more stable objective principle and for example the number people who use these dialects and should probably include first those that are major are probably don't know the territory that they cover maybe another one taken them out this one was advising this one like move this one somewhere maybe that's not the kind stable principal and one more thing you gave definition kind definition dialect the very beginning your presentation and you the very beginning your presentation and you defined as theme that includes (eh) particular vocabulary particular grammar and you don't mention pronunciation here phonetics the slide but is kind presupposed yeah all right think just forgot yeah it's essential feature course and then for example when you speak about Cockney dialect you not mention any grammatical features do they exist and they don't can be considered the dialect (eh) think should considered (eh) dialect (eh) even Cockney doesn't have any grammatical features (eh) believe does didn't really go very deep into that even it doesn't have any special grammatical features (eh) they means that they are just sort normal and usual and just like some other parts Britain again we attempt approach these things kind scientifically academically research way yeah then that means that either your definition Cockney dialect wrong it doesn't have grammatical features like any dialect should the definition dialect wrong and shouldn't include grammar that it's either one the other way and you may choose one the variants but you should stick one principle then yeah (mhm) you're saying that dog an animal with this this and that feature and one animal doesn't have that feature maybe that's not dog how can you prove (eh) and just for personally which dialect Jamie Oliver talking Jamie Oliver yeah because you showed him the (eh) the slide was one the one the videos the one who cooked yeah yeah the cooker (eh) I'm not mistaken speaks very clear Estuary dialect Estuary thank you and we're moving to very unusual (eh) presentation hope which little bit different from everything else (eh) you are welcome
