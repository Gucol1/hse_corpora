good afternoon dear ladies first let introduce myself you name I'm student Perm State Medical University named after academician Evgeniy Antonovich Wagner and I'm student medical faculty today would like (um) speak about one the most actual problems my mind this the problem choice main directions residency specializations among six-year-students Perm State Medical University We consider the topic according the next plan first speak about the relevance I tell you about the situation residency and postgraduate education Russia then show you materials and methods that used this work then discuss results (em) what specialties are the most important for students our university and theme want finish presentation with the conclusion where speak aboutю what points are the most important my mind (em) let's begin шt's not secret that two years ago there was фищдшешщт internship and we compare other fields not only the field medicine, can also see the reduction the number places for postgraduate education for example (um) last year there were one hundred and seventy-one places and only thirty-nine directions among residency Russia and that's why think the actuality choices different specializations (em) directions very important for medical students because according this information they can estimate the number places and they can count their own chances as example (um) want speak about cardiology I'm interested this field and want become (em) cardiologist future (uh) for example last year our university there were two places this speciality but this year are happy say that have three places course you can say that this not remarkable but think that it's real step for improvement the aim my work was determine the level importance main directions residency specializations among the six-year students Perm State Medical University fifty seven students our university participated the research all these students (em) were students six year and they studied the medical faculty our medical faculty (em) among six year students have two hundred and fifty students and all them were offered fill online form Interest future specialization choice residency and two hundred and fifty students only fifty-seven students agreed give answers that twenty three percent here you can see some questions from our form the questions were simple because (em) wanted give exact answers for example what speciality have you chosen why have you chosen this speciality why have you entered Perm State Medical University and the answer about motivation let's discuss the results the research was found out that among students our university the most demanded specialities are obstetrics and gynecology with cardiology that fourteen percent next comes pediatrics therapy gastroenterology surgery general surgery pathologic anatomy that seven percent the less demanded were dermatology and orthopedics functional detections support medicine and allergology that five percent but the less demanded were oral surgery .thoracic surgery that 3.5% and were disappointed that one the students choose rheumatology and physiology Here you can see the main reasons for choice the main them were the authority specialization high salary (em) students choose the high salary when (em) they choose surgery dream easy education easy education students think that this about therapy because you compare residency therapy and surgery therapy will easier back plan large number vacancies family dynasty and saving lives And the contrary the reasons for not choice boring study this not about boring long study don't want be doctor narrow speciality students want become not specialist narrow speciality they want be therapy general for example. and work polyclinics Big competition this about places residency the risk infections this much about why our students haven't chosen physiatry disappointed medicine and the lack knowledge so conclusion (um) would like say that due the limited places residency students must study harder and they also must take part other extracurricular activities for points their future residency more than that is necessary inform students about new rules residency and about places also teachers can interview students the fourth and fourth year and the sixth year compare their interests medicine here you can see the list references and thank you for attention I'm ready answer your questions 
thank you lets ask her some questions 
why are less few places for your speciality 
sorry why 
why you need free ology 
oh because students (um) sorry you mean (em) why students the fourth year must interview
yes
because. when speak with the first second year students (uh) they (um) don't have their own choose when (er) who they want become doctor and fourth fourth fourth year students know because (um) clinical disciplines our university start the fourth year and students know much and .they know what specialities they choose 
I not very well familiar with the system medical education but (uh) right say (uh) that this step optional medical education (uh) some students might choose not go residency all 
so you are right some students can (uh) after graduating from our university (uh) they become (um) therapists it's general doctor and they can work only polyclinics but you want become doctor narrow speciality for example, cardiology surgery, you must enter the residency 
how you think the recent law about the compulsory work students therapists (em) to the graduation what the reason this law and will be effective 
the law about residency 
compulsory work for our students therapist for three years 
...frankly speaking (um) didn't think about but.. think that won't so effective because .as rule students have their their own choose in. sixth year and also said about back plan for example students ... (em) students can enter another to another direction residency for example you didn't enter (um) cardiology you can enter general therapy and later you can educate cardiology for during two months
 any other questions. thank you.
