 and intellectual property in the fashion industry...
hello. so. our topic is patent law and intellectual property in the fashion industry...
in recent years intellectual property rights. have played a pivotal role in the growth of the highly competitive fashion industry. which generates about. two trillion dollars per year.. when considering interrupt intellectual property within the fashion industry. the most notable challenge is handling the protection of numerous designs on a seasonal basis...
the addition of new industrial designs to a fashion line can also be protected by. (er) patent.. this refers to any product that has distinctive visual features.. in our work we explore ways of protecting intellectual property in the fashion an. industry. as well as carrying out a comparative analysis. of the regulation of this sphere in different countries.. we focus. on the liability. arising from. (er) intellectual property infringement (er) and (er) study in detail examples of such violations among well-known brands...
copying in the fashion isn't new. and key players (er) in the fashion industry almost constantly face. accusations. of (eh) plag= plagiarism.. (er) sometimes such accusations are. for advertising purposes only. (er) and some and enter into battles (er) in social networks. on social networks. in order to compete.. (er) for instance. during New York Fashion Week. (eh) famous American designer. Alexander Wang. (erh) caught (eh) on his Instagram page. caught (er) famous German designer Philipp Plein (er) in. copying style and scenery. (eh) others. however. bring their cases to trial with the real financial consequences.. (er) so where is the line between inspiration and illegal copying of someone else's work. and is there. legal protection against plagiarism...
in Russian law. plagiarism is understood as the most. (er) common method of copyright infringement. namely the appropriation of the autho= authorship (er) of an item. and all the rights held by the true author.. an obvious example of plagiarism in the fashion industry is copying. product design...
(er) from the point of (eh) view of Russian law. plagiarism is difficult to prove.. the Russian civil code establishes. a presumption of authorship. (er) copyright to designer arises by virtue of the fact of its (eh) creation in an objectified form. without requiring. (eh) any. formalities. such as registration.. however the lack of such formalities makes it difficult to prove. that. the design of the product has been copied.. in addition. even small changes. may indicate a new. intellectual result... it seems that over time. (eh) jurisprudence will be able to breach the gap between (er) copying someone else's work and. (er) creating a new one under the influence of other works.. (er) but now (er) it is. difficult. (erm) as to reveal a general trend...
in addition to copyright. the appearance of a product can be also. protected by an industrial design patent.. to obtain protection. the appearance of the product in its significant features. must be new and original..
to sum up. it should be noted. that in Russia. the design of product is protected by co= copyright.. (er) if the product is. the result. of the author's creativity. (er) and intellectual work. and by patent law. if the product is unique.. in addition. we believe. that it would be better to improve the registration procedure. (er) because (em) despite the fact that. patent law (er) is much more effective than copyright law. (er) it is very long and costly...
European countries. have a two tier system for. regulating this issue.. (er) there is national legislation and general legislation for all EU member states.. the first country where the protection of the copyright of fashion designers. was expressly provided by law was France.. in French courts. (er) it is. not uncommon for. French designers to take legal action against manufacturers committing plagiarism.. thus back in nineteen ninety four. the lawsuit of Yves Saint Laurent. (er) brought against the American designer Ralph Lauren. in connection with the violation of. (er) the plaintiff's lost rights. to the tuxedo dress. was considerate and satisfied.. according to the court's. decision. the defendant paid the plaintiff. a total of. three hundred ninety five thousand dollars... a directive. (erm) of the European Parliament and Cou= Council in nineteen ninety eight. legitimised. (er) tion of a. special design law. in all. EU member states.. the design of a product is defined as.. the appearance of all or part of the product due to features and particular lines. contours. color. shapes. (erm) textures and materials. (em) and ornaments...
however. if European legislation is based. on the need to protect copyright. of clothes and in the fashion industry. the United States is not the case.. thi= this is not. the case.. the fashion industry. is the second largest industry in the United States. after the financial industry.. (er) there are more than. eight hundred (eh) fashion companies. in the country.. at the same time. there is no law. (er) in the United States. that protect clothing rights.. despite this. the design of products. in the United States. can be. protected by cou=. court copyright (eh) precedents (eh) patent law. (eh) for example. the design ver= ver= Vernetta bag and Crocs. (erh) and their design. can be registered. as a trade dress.. for example. (eh) the red sole of Louboutin shoes. and Tiffany's blue packaging... however. copyright. protection in the United States. is ineffective...
first based on the ian. concept (erm) utilitarian concept of. clothing. and other fashion products.. United States copyright does not protect the author's personal rights to their design.. model of clothing in general.. the conceptual separation test. developed by. the practice of American courts. is also not always objectively. applicable to determine. the tactics. of the. subsequent protection of a truly unique and creative work. or fashion design.. as a result. in most cases. the design of clothing. or (eh) accessories. can be copied without. negative legal consequences.. in this regard. many brands resort.. to. other ways. to protect. the rights to. their original product ideas.. for example. the famous Birkin co box from. Herm√®s.. are registered. in the. United States as trade dress.. such vigilance. allowed the French fa= fashion house in.. (em) twenty twelve to collect losses of. one hundred. million dollars from three dozen websites.. for selling fake copies...
with the advent. of the Industrial Revolution. when production volumes began to gain. unprecedent proportions. (eh) companies began to develop trade dress. (er) the asso authenticity. of products. was now. (eh) determined (er) by a patent name. (er) the clothing industry became a  for manufacturers of illegal (eh) copies. because clothing was. the most (eh) demonstrative way. to make a statement to the public. look. I can afford it...
in the mid. two thousands. Burberry. a respected British brand. with a long history. was. on the verge. of bankruptcy because marginal. individuals from disadvantaged (eh) English areas. which severely. (er) affected the company's. image. bought up fakes. with a branded cage... (er) in.. two thousand four. eighteen percent. of all counterfeit products. in the world. were those with the. Louis Vuitton logo.. by the way. this brand. is one of the most copied so far. along with. UGG and Rolex.. for example. forty million fake watches are produced annually. which means that the brand loses about. six hundred. (er) million dollars..
in two thousand and four. Tiffany sued eBay. claiming that. eighty percent. of the products.  their website. with their label. were fake.. (eh) the same story happened two years later.. (er) with the fashion conglomerate L V M H. ninety percent of their. (em) products. displayed on eBay by the Louis Vuitton. Dior. and others. turned out to be fake.. by the way. the company then won the case. and eBay had to pay a compensation. of sixty three million dollars... the problem of counterfeiting of course. doesn't apply. only. to luxury brands.. (er) no black market is complete. without Adibas sneakers Nice. instead of Nike. and a Lacoste Polo with a crocodile. that looks like (er) as.. it... if it were staffed with hormones. (em) in two thousand eleven. more than twelve million copies. of all products sold under the Adidas label. turned out to be fakes.. (eh) by the way. original Nike sneakers cost about one hundred and fifty dollars. an exact copy of (er) such sneakers. produced in China. at costs of. thirteen dollars. and then sold for sixty dollars...
thus the regulation of the rights. to clothing design is one of the least harmonized. areas of intellectual property law.. unfortunately. there is no univer= universial way. to protect against plagiarism. in the field of design.. moreover. plagiarism. in fashion. can be both. intentional and accidental.. and the line between open copying and inspiration is very thin.. so the comma will be put (er) by the curt. (er) by the court. depending on the. circumstances. of a particular case.. in this case. we recommend promoting the idea of plagiarism. and the use of fakes as an anti-trend...
of course. some people believe. that not everyone can afford to buy. expensive thing.. so there is nothing wrong with wearing and buying a fake thing. things.. however. if you buy clothes. from a fake producer. you will. (er) support illegal activities. and the number of fake things will increase. (er) which will lead to. a loss of your. favorite designer's profit...
thank you for your attention...
please dear audience.  have any questions.. to the speakers..D00:11:54.560
 why have you chosen this. (eh) issue. or topic to discuss ...
well. we're (erm) big fans of. fashion. (er) because we're. girls. maybe.. (er) and (em) we noticed. that lots of people. (erm) (eh) use fake things like. (er) bags (eh) from Louis Vuitton but it's not from Louis Vuitton. (em) that's all...
 . thank you very much for your. good presentation.. well. I'm focusing. on intellectual property in my legal practice. that's why this. (em) theme is very. interesting. for me.. well. and I wanted to ask a question.. do you think that trademark protection. is also one of a good instrument to. well. to protect your design. or to. fight against the counterfeit..
yeah. thank you for your question. (eh) we believe that trademark. is. also one of the most. (eh) useful.. methods. to protect. your products.. so.. it is used. as well.
especially in America..
well. actually and in Russia. because well the (erm) the question of. is it an infringement of the trademark. is the easiest one between the questions.. iIs it. infringement of your copyright.. or a patent.. well. can I ask one more question. well. actually. you said that. it's better to. improve the registration procedure. in Russia concerning the. patent.. of. the patenting of (eh) industrial designs. right..
yes
well. probably you've got some. purposes. how can. we improve it...
speaking frankly. we believe. that. it is necessary to create. an international system of. (er) (eh) protection this sphere. but (eh) in Russia. (erh) this process is. quite long and. costly because you have to. (eh) learn a lot of information and. probably have to spend your money to go to the. special. places. bureau. patent bureau. so (erh) we believe that (mhm) there is. a lack of. (eh).. laws. international laws...
what about the Hague convention. concerning the international registration process. of (eh) industrial. designs... well. it's not that popular. as the Madrid agreement for trademarks or the patent cooperation treaty or other patents. as inventions. . well. however. there is one. there is one. the Hague convention gives us possibility to. make your registration easy. and to get the patent in the two countries.. well. however. I agree with you. that it's not that widespread as other conventions.. therefore. (erh) probably. we should.. well.. influence other countries. to entry. because Russia is a part of that convention since. two thousand.. eighteen.. if I'm not mistaken. or nineteen. something.. well. thank you once again for your presentation
