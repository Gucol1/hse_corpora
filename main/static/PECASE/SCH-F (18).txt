can you see screen then hello dear speakers and panel I would like present you work comparative analysis catalase activity tissues different fish species (um) is known that enzymes play crucial role the regulation chemical reactions metabolism enzymes are found all living creatures from small microorganisms too big mammals various researchers conducted different countries over the past decades confirm that one the causes pathological changes living organisms the excessive accumulation oxygen free radicals and reactive oxygen species such for example high (um) hydrogen peroxide which leads oxidative stress oxidative stress condition caused excessive formation reactive oxygen species some organisms (uh) the effect reactive oxygen species the functional activity cells twofold (uh) normally O Are involved the metabolism the structural components cell membranes proteins lipids and carbohydrates but when there an excess ROS proteins lipids and carbohydrates and acids as well cellular structures are being destroyed (uh) this situation has serious health consequences for human beings well such skin aging increased risk cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and general cell damage and some traumatic brain lesions and different mental issues and addictions are also associated with oxidative stress. but during the evolution organisms order protect ourselves from oxidative stress have developed variety different protective mechanisms form antioxidant system (um) the antioxidant system consists such low molecular weight components vitamin and . and such enzymes catalase peroxides and many others (um) this slide you can see the purpose and some goals my (um) work besides have assumed that pike an inactive predator catalase can manifest greater activity than or white fish that was our hypothesis. So talking about catalase (uh) you may wonder what catalase catalase enzyme that catalyzes the composition hydrogen peroxide into water and molecular oxygen (um) despite the fact that hydrogen peroxide product many normal metabolic processes (uh) is not harmless the body order prevent the destruction cells and tissues hydrogen peroxide must quickly converted into another substance which will less dangerous for the body this the biological task the enzyme catalase catalase one the fastest enzymes and only one its molecule capable converting millions hydrogen peroxide molecules (uh) into water and oxygen second the reaction takes place two steps which you can see the slide (uh) the activity catalase depends many factors (uh) the dependence this indicator the age the body was revealed in younger tissues the catalase more active than old ones besides there are some cancerous growths the body the decrease the activity catalase the liver and kidneys can also detected moreover there correlation between the size and speed growth the tumors and the degree reduction catalase activity the liver (um) there are lots different methods for determining catalase activity (um) they can based their registration the formed oxygen during the reaction they manometric and polographic methods (uh) they can also based concentration on the currents the measurements current concentration hydrogen peroxide is spectrophotometry and they can based (uh) measurements residual concentration hydrogen peroxide they are iodometric method and permanganate metric and permanganate metric method (um) my work our work have studied three fish species belonging different links (uh) food chain pike predator and vendors and whitefish consuming mainly small organisms the water bottom invertebrates and small fish the fish was caught lake Onega and the fall twenty nineteen and immediate after the capture the fish was frozen until the analysis (um) before the analysis the analysis the fish was thought and (uh) samples liver were taken with scalpel and with the scalpel and tweezers (uh) two samples from each fish have taken two samples from each fish order get more reliable results (um) weight was carried out plastic containers namely (uh) test tubes for type gentrification and after weighing (um) the homogenization and were carried out you can see the test tubes right here yeah (um) the resulting the catalase activity and the concentration the proteins were detained were determined the Bradford methods since the activity enzymes usually recalculated protein concentration therefore needed calculate the concentration the proteins (um) And the most common spectrophotometric method for determining protein concentration the Bradford method and you can see Marion Bradford who developed this method (um) order determine the concentration soluble protein was necessary construct calibration charged calibration charge based standard solutions using the collaboration tool graph and the equation the resulting straight line calculated the protein concentration tissues with allowance for delusion delusion (um) yeah you can see how did and it's like (um) and catalase activity was determined the optical density drop solution the spectrophotometer which you can see the slide (um) after that the results were substituted into the equation for calculating the activity the activity the enzyme you can see the equation the side too (um) our results you can see the slide the concentration the protein was the highest pikes liver and the lowest liver. (uh) have predicted to say this results but for the activity catalase. (um) was the highest liver and the lowest pike's liver our hypothesis was not confirmed (um) as can see here the activity catalase differs fish different species therefore this indicator can called can show species specificity (um) and we have found out that (uh) the catalase activity the highest the liver the vendors and you can see the results right here like numbers (um) suppose that this may mean that more active utilization hydrogen peroxide happening liver and most likely such differences are related the peculiarities habitats and type nutrition because vendors mainly lives the surface water bodies while the white fish lives the deep (uh) the deep layers the water and pike the water column even have even have special upper mouth for feeding the surface (uh) we made conclusion that the activity the enzyme catalase depends the ecological group the species and wanted add that (um) changes the activity catalase can help to identify damages the the ecosystem the early stages and would with help this (um) with this with the help (uh) finding out what's the activity catalase can create early warning system which guess can helpful for the environment (uh) and thank you for your attention
(uh) question would the following okay can test like pro ecology (uh) far got measuring catalase the livers fishes but question would can tests maybe these methods already exist can test our health our own level oxidative stress similar methods?
(um) yeah I guess that's possible we also have this enzyme (um) and it's also operating our organisms (um) I guess there are some special ways test the activity your enzymes your own body (um) guess it's more connected with the medicine and (um) I'm not sure it possible right now but guess uh we can test our N and on can test the activity different enzymes our body and catalase showing low activity your liver for example kidneys guess you should to the doctor other doctors and test yourself (um) for having different tumors maybe something like that yeah I guess you can relevant yeah
what are the perspectives your study?
(um) I guess can continue study testing more different fishes and maybe finding out more (uh) correlation the activity this enzyme (um) with different things (uh) and guess can continue study (um) creating this early warning system and maybe (um) working with the university together (uh) make (uh) more practical to people that are not connected with the science and our like don't know much about catalase but (um) can (uh) with the help the university can (um) help our the environment our region continuing this work guess
