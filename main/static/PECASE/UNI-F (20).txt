 the last speaker the section will (name the speaker) and move using cognitive linguistics we typically work art thank you much good afternoon ladies and gentlemen name (name the speaker) and today the topic my speech using cognitive linguistics way analyze and interpret literary work art and this study based the novel Mother's Love Alan DenTek Groundless the object the literary concept motherhood experience which which represents the generalized (er) experience mother which researched the example the protagonist this novel.
(er) the subject linguistic means obviously the language that represents the concept and have couple aims the first one to analyze the verbal representation the concept and understand cognitive linguistics can used an approach the analysis and interpretation an artwork .but before jump straight would like tell you couple definitions basically the study based cognitive linguistics and it's linguistic approach that focuses language general cognitive mechanism and tool (er) system science that plays role coding (er) and transformation information okay then (er) I've already mentioned concept but what it what the concept it's mental structure that reflects the values both the individual and the entire linguistic community frame way organize that concept and later I'll show you our frame and (er) discourse it's spoken outreach and communications between people context (er) should stop here and it'll because obviously there are lot types discourses like political discourse war discourse even prison discursive but now are talking about literary discourse and want point out that the study literally based the cognitive discourse analysis that's why (er) I'm asking pay the attention literally discourse depends the author's worldview what does mean the ideas that the author wants (er) tell in his book obviously comes from his head anthropocentrism mean means that the book written human for other people read literally discourse only born the process reading okay let show you notes this just the text (er) and only when start reading only once start processing only then becomes discourse (er) also has literally discourse has declared sorry my God I'm sorry cultural significance the author tries have impact the recipient values and cause emotional reaction which leads reflexivity and that leads the spiritual essences being born okay now coming the work itself here you can see our frame which called obviously Mother who'd experience and (er) let tell you about that the plot the story together with the frame the story itself the speech the mother during the alcoholics anonymous meeting where she tells the story about her motherhood experience (er) which obviously starts from the point where her daughter Marianne born (er) the story starts with her daughter childhood this where you have first slot childhood here mother expresses how beautiful her daughter everyone adores her she's very docile manageable and the media obviously the loves and then go the adult life just subdivided to the before the accident and after the accident here have the teenage years Marianne starts being aggressive and the mother starts depicting her beast violent and dangerous but later Marianne gets into the car accident and she forced come back home here have baby angel docile sweet we have .. comeback the childhood now are focusing only the two slots which which our childhood and adult life because these slots using the description the main characters daughter determine the nature the relationship the family and also this nature relationship can established examining the semantic connections the first one here have childhood and you see childhood Marian long the mother could control her she appears us (er) only docile manageable obedient and exemplary schoolgirl qualities that are fundamental importance for her mother but soon Marianne Marianne leaves the house the protagonist begins describe her daughter completely different way subconsciously choosing words with negative connotation outrageous she compares her the beast and she's violent talking about here are comparing after the accident after the accident Marianne returns home all the bones are broken and she's forced take peels her old character returns which makes obviously the mother happy (er) but is worth noting that even though have these words that are lexical synonyms they are not contextual synonyms because (er) the daughter's soft character returns due the fact that the mother intentionally increases the dose medication and the daughter remains under her control this fact does not allow to treat Marianne childhood and Marianne her adult life after the accident equally what can get from .. some the problems the problems the story the problems the story the protagonist appears us antiprotagic mother in other words cannibalistic mother (er) she wants control her life the daughter way that she absolutely controls her and annihilates her then have problem overproduction (er) her love actually nothing more but overprotection the problem generation values (er) this becomes clear when Marianne runs away from home and she's tired from her mother's constant manipulation and Marianne tries provoke her mother and confront her values and here can see also social criticism the Almaden Grandis novels and also can say that our protagonist actually narcissistic individualist from postmodernism era and underground not afraid showing atypical characters women who have various forms love even toxic and deviated and for the conclusions we have created frame the concept motherhood experience and looked the verbal representation have studied semantic relations and appeared be that have more antonyms and synonyms the main character appears be anti-hero and obviously using cognitive linguistics together with cognitive discourse analysis can used better interpret and the content an artwork thank you for your attention and you have any questions I'm willing answer them thank you ... you study the novel right originally Spanish not particular Spanish  (mhm) Spanish and the words that you showed the slides (er) characterising the daughter they come from the text itself (mhm) these are quotations manageable all them (er) Are Derica taken it's not your interpretation well yes yes it's translation from Spanish English but (er) the thing that for example from Spanish Russian is much harder translate but when have (er) that's obviously docile and going have obedient have obedient also English translations not very complicated yeah Just clear can this come back the slide where you find discourse liter= literary discourse when you show these characteristics can say to cover the title that you are talking about for example newspaper discourse journalistic discourse philosophy discourse or let say (er) sports discourse ok see that's all these characteristics also can applied number other kinds discourses what makes particular literary discourse separate one from the them  okay as for sport discourse don't really have (er) the author's worldview come we the always express their opinion fine but they see that going in real life writer also sees something that's going in real life yes and then they change interpret in their own way sports also interpreted that with Real Madrid winning but Barsa winning who better mean that's always interpretation subjectivity okay also have study about interpretation and subjectivity know that there no answer this can argue no not this to literally discourse (er) but so for literally discourse the main thing about is that the author tries (er) impact our worldview our orientation values sports commentaries they don't really want to what are they  my God  therefore entertaining influencing our opinion advertising okay I mean again any kind discourse impacted otherwise it's not discourse otherwise it's text it's text yes well okay but .so you need be mean go and You should find . (er) literary feature that makes fine fine fine when have one speak about some (mm) literary (mm) means don't know anything like again can find hyperboles metaphors sports discourse etc etc.. easy esthetics esthetics okay fine (mhm) (mumbling something always) general question (er) (er) (er) when we're going into cognitive analysis and concept analysis together with frames .we also use (er) notion scenario.. right I'm not really sure because academic supervisor hasn't mentioned  ask (name the supervisor) abou= about that what mean when you present (er) political slots of of the book this rather scenario this chronological sequence events how they follow each other you mean variant  yeah cause this what happens first then happens this then happens yes but there's the second the third slot which attitude her daughter and does not depend the plot it's just the combination everything (mhm) but you you don't consider I don't consider not because it's not important but it's just (er) semantic relations can seen that's what what you focus is rather scenario the concept well particularly here yes (mhm) but not frame and what would suggest that what you bring the end your presentation and we're talking about (er) and (er) narcissism cetera these are conceptual frames motherhood motherhood what this text is being narcissistic is being overprotective etc etc these are components that form this concept yes but when study (er) the frame. have take into the consideration verbal representation don't really have lot or you mean that should have named the slots based this that's right yes and you will definitely find verbalization these things otherwise you haven't concluded them yeah For example being beast yeah swallowing .. that's about yeah kind these things kind food etc etc generations I'm sure they will  else yeah (er) I'm sorry ask another basic question you mentioned those frames way organizing concert right since could say may couple more words about how you well how you interpret and how you are using your analysis  well yeah okay but cognitive linguistics and everything that connected cognitive science broad and vague that's why use such (er) definition. but anyway frame (er) so it's way organizing concept way that (er) understandable and clear from (er) the literary discourse that I'm studying and the people who are listening me think well who are is that frame the text the discourse your study of your discourse no of the concept the work art that are researching ... right (er) well because I'm much more familiar with (er) the different term also cognitive linguistics term schema and schemata and doesn't sound vague me all but frame for example if you're using this model right (er) it most schem= schema te= te= term if you this and I'm right you're saying that this frame for the concept motherhood experiences expressed this particular novel right (er) obviously there lot choice involved possibly the whole novel could could seen an expression (mm) expression motherhood right . yeah you were introduced this categorization you've chosen have this thing called childhood with the list adjectives called adult life ho= before for that's how are you making these choices how you decide well what gets into your frame and what what doesn't get into your frame as was explained (er) my (er) supervisor that cognitive linguistics and well cognitive discourse analysis way (er) for as researcher create own frame basically obviously you create the frame the same story would have different frames but that way it's just the most understandable (er) you know expression ideas and expression representatives and that can come across the text as you were reading the text you felt that these are these are important categories that matter (er) what you're remodeling not much the text it your emphasised sort your understanding your the text yes and also should mentioned that it's not the whole frame the concept because (er) don't really have lot time here and don't really have (er) the whole (er) cognitive linguists section for everyone understand simplified so but actually there wasn't also would would understand need simplify yes now understand yeah also there was the adult life also has subdivision into alcohol yeah like alcoholic problem mother because obviously she's telling speech the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting also did that childhood was divided into for example like the character the daughter and her description and here combine them fine yeah and another general question what would you well what does this (hm) cognitive. driven don't know approach (er) bring the table I mean for you reader and as person who comes with interpretation an artwork right what possibilities has this cognitive approach opened for you could you tell  okay first all (mm) we take this text Spanish text and (er) next year aim and goal to translate this text from Spanish Russian that's why (er) also had definite definition analysis (er) obviously that's the first one but except for that there also possibility obviously everything (er) from this conclusion the problematic these text clear when you read that the character awful but (er) when study the semantic relations actually get much more information about this character not just seeing (er) and also connect connected with cognitive literature studies we have this thing and where take words and don't take them for granted we don't just (er) you know just make our opinions based what read but actually read into the text and only from that based their words and their definitions only then make conclusions  these are something else semantic analysis the analysis but the question what cognitive approach gives you what cognitive approach gives yeah and give to maybe paraphrase that digital altered course then myself well the end you see that this approach allows to better understand better than what better than we didn't it better that nothing yeah better than nothing that's but in the way so you mean what does that give me from the cognitive ... then create there something else doesn't as reader and as researcher with yeah doing this okay now just have clear vision how this story can built and from which (er) perceptions can look the story and for example have this motherhood experience and so I take from own experience research from the literature point view and then can conclusion that not only an individual but also the entire linguistic community pretty much understands the concept thank you very much
