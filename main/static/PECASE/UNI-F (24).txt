the first speaker today. who going talk about the influence. law. on. the World Trade Organization.. on. Russian 
hello.. name. and (em) (er) demonstrate you (er) topic my research. and (er) is the influence law the World Trade Organization (er) law over Russian Federation.. (er) World Trade Organization one the biggest (er) organizations the world. and is also international and (er) intergovernmental. which (er) decided (em) decide the (mm) some issues connected with (er) trade (er) and (er) economic (er) issues and conflicts (er) state members (er) these very organizations.. (er) and there are some important T purposes (er) and the first main purpose (er) (er) (er) build (er) liberalized (er) trade union (er) among the (mm) state members the World Trade organization (er) and the second one (er) raise living standards (er) the Third World countries.. (er) the next one (er) full employment and constant growth real income.. (er) and the last (er) expansion production (er) and trade goods and services... here you can see participants (eh) the World Trade Organization.. (er) this almost all countries (er) right now (er) T there are. one hundred and ninety four countries. (er) and you can see Russia also participant (eh) the World Trade Organization. (er) and.. Russia became. participant. participant (er) (er) eight years ago. in (eh) 2012. and was very difficult process become (er) member (er) the T (er) because (em) there were some (er) disagreements legal science. (er) legal society (er) when (eh) (mm) was discussion (er) join not join (er) the World Trade Organization.. and.. here you can see some reasons. why needed this. and why (er) joined (er) World Trade Organization. the first one (eh) special right use special mechanism (er) resolve trade disputes. in T there unique (er) (erm) element (er) and is called (er) dispute settlement body which helps (er) state members (er) (mm) solve (er) conflict situation (er) (er) (mhm) some (mm) different trade (er) topics.. (er) and is good opportunity for Russia use it.. (er) the next reason (er) stabilization Russian foreign trade (eh) legislation because one the (er).. one the purposes (er) of. (er) World Trade Organization. to build (er) liberalized. union (er) the trade. community. and (er) the last reason (eh) reduction. import and export duties... in research. analyzed.. and suggestions.. (eh) and suggested (er) some solutions. how solve (er) problems.. (er) what have (er) (mm) functioning and indirection (er) the T with the (em) with our country.. and. the first problem (er) found (er) was. incomplete. systematization. Russia (er) Russian legal acts under T standards.. it means (er) that there are. binding principles. (er) Marrakesh agreements (er) this basic agreement (eh) T (mm) there are. basic agreements (er) which (eh) are not (mhm) (er) in. Russian legislation. (er) mean that (er) there are some. laws that break (er) that break (er) T legislation. for example. (er) the federal law (er) number. two hundred twenty five. (er) there (er) special. quota of. seventy percent.. using (er) Russian (er) technical equipment.. (er) when. for example. (mm) foreign. businessman wants (mm) build business our country.. (er) and this is. (er) also (mm) breaks (eh) the principle. (eh) Wor= World Trade Organization. because. (er) (mm) (er) doesn't provide (er) (mm) way to. build this business.. and offered my research that (er) need (er) amend this law (er) and (er) (mm) and have not seventy percent quota. but fifty percent (er) because (er) is (er) (mm) (er) good way decide this problem. because (er) twenty percent (er) twenty percent the difference. also (mm) way decide this problem. and can (mm) real (er) reason why. foreign businessmen (er) can. join. our (mm) economic. situation.. the next problem. con= connected with (er) the economy situation. our country. and.. is about the competition between. different industries.. in. it was one the. main disagreements. why (er) (mm) legal society. didn't want (er) (mm) to. join the T (er) because (er).. Russia there are. some weak (er) (mm) industries. for example (mm) machine or. consumer industries (er) and (er) for example (er) Russian Lada. can't. stand (er) Mercedes. Toyota. (er) and (er) that's why is problem.. (er) and. the. probable solution (er) establish law (er) which will imply high import tariff and lower export tariff for (er) these companies... the next problem (er) connected with. the lack of. dispu= (eh) dispute (eh) resolution system. (er) (er) the beginning. my (er) speech. started (er) talk about (er) dispute settlement body.. (er) this unique body (er) T (er) which (eh) helps (er) which helps (er) state members (er) solve (er) different trade conflicts between. these state members. and Russia (er) there isn't. any (mm) commission (er) who will provide (er) (mm) and (er) help to. support (er) this (er) (mm) trade organization.. And that's why (er) offered... offered (er) to... sorry... offered (er) did late night. (er) offered. special procedure. how (mm) establish (er) this procedure Russia.. (er) and (eh) the basic (er) (mm) was (er) a. system German.. (er) and so. th= the main idea. need. (er) (mm) establish special resolution commission. who will (eh) be. representative (eh) (er) World Trade Organization. and (er) decide our (mm) our. trade conflicts with (er) (er) other countries. in. our. state. and then (er) will sent (mm) Geneva. World Trade Organization director.. and. the last problem is. very common. (er) (mm) also found the problem. when made. this research. that. there (eh) the absence of. codified act international sources over T law.. (er) (er) there are. many. many acts (er) (mm) which (er) helps (er) (er) World Trade Organization to. organize (er) (mm) the community. but (er) there isn't any (mm) codified act. we can find only. Marrakesh agreement. and that's it. (er) and (er) offered to. create special (mm) legal. codes (er) (er) which will (er) have (er) some common (er) (mm) for example introductions and (er) regulations (mm) connected with (eh) (mm) trade (er) organizations. but not (er) connected with (er) (mm) with th= wi= with the action. World Trade Organization... that's it. Thank you for your attention...
thank you very much. ...
Please not hesitate ask any questions. ..
well. thank you very much for your presentation. was good. confident.. well (em) I'm sure that you know about the T law (er) much more. than do.. well. I'm got some questions. about your last. purpose (erm) concerning the codified act international sources.. well (eh) you mean that. the T law. there are. many international sources. that we. need codify them. well. for. (em) well. for better use. for what.. well. mean. you told that there Marrakesh agreement.. it's not that big.. well probably can use this one..
(er) so. mean. that (er) ther= aren't. many (mm)... there aren't many documents (er) (eh) which (eh). help to. understand. the.. the trade purposes. (er) the World Trade Organization. and the Marrakesh agreement (er) establishes (er) the procedure. (er) for example (er) (mm). Marrakesh agreement. doesn't (eh) tell anything about (er) how. to. (mm) make trades (er) liberalized. for example. I. made some. purposes World Trade Organization and Marrakesh agreement. doesn't tell us. anything about how do it. how (er) to. for example. establish it. in (er) (mm). different (erm) nationalities (er) and (eh) Marrakesh agreement (er) there only (mm) the way. how. to.. organize. the organization.. and (er) (mm).. and commissions different countries.. and think that (eh) this information not enough maybe (er) build. (eh) real (eh) liberalized (er) community our world (er) (er) among state (er) members.. and that's why maybe need add something. to. Marrakesh agreement create. new code...
(uhu) (uhu) well (er) asked this question because seems that you're talking about the greater codification of. private international law. right..
(mm) no.. (er) think it's useless. (er) because (eh) wh= why.. don't (mm) just look (er) (mm) some acts and (er) have this information (er) but (er) (mm) I'm talking about. that need to. maybe. establish new rules. and (er) (mm) having. have in. common code. that will (er) connect with (er) the trade. not with th=. not with the. (mm) World Trade Organization only...
(uhu)
it's. it's not about (er). some (mhm) how say. (er) private. rights of. different citizens. not about it.. more about politics.. trade. politics
okay.. thank you
