 then give the floor (name speaker) we from pronouncing surname correctly and we'll move to linguistic means reconstruction oral tradition Tolkien thank you once again good afternoon dear colleagues I'm glad see you here and today would like present research (er) Linguistic means construction oral tradition Tolkien's fairy tales in this light you can see some my presentation First all will talk about epic poem Beowulf part Tolkien's academic research (er) and give you some basic information about the epic poem itself is very important focus according my research (er) then will turn Talkien's fairy tale (er) which called Savage Spell and show you the main expressive and descriptive means the text according oral tradition and after that will make conclusion let's start you know (er) John Ronald (name writer) Tolkien was not only great writer father high fantasy but also talented academic the nineteen twenties (er) Tolkien under two interest lation the epic poem from old English modern English finished the translation 1926 but actually didn't publish It was finally edited his son Christopher Tolkien and published only twenty fourteen fact (er) Beowulf one the greatest examples Anglo-Saxon literature this story was passed orally from generation generation and then was written down an anonymous writer the 8th century. today we know it's manuscript housed the British Library London (er) for long time such of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf where based the historical context however. Tolkien always draw attention the previous neglect= previously neglected literary qualities the poem and argued that should studied work art not just (er) simple historical document and indeed nowadays there an active growth scientific interest the side the through its folklore elements that can help other researchers identify the formation process the survived poem version have have already sorry mentioned first the epic point was passed orally from generation generation and (er) we can guess the folklore elements that can find the text the epic poem are also based oral tradition but what it what the oral tradition itself (er) well oral tradition form human communication wherein .some information received preserved and transmitted orally from genere= from one generation another if you see the logic here there logic here the transmission through speech song and may also include (er) folk tales ballads chants prose .and others things (er).. having examined this surviving version the poem Beowulf the 1940s Tolkien like Anglo Saxon Scope storyteller (er) created (name the tale) (name the tale) fairy tale (er) can also call like pre saga according the Irish tradition just fantasy quick piece Beowulf biographical background that (er) could have been passed orally from one person another Long before the epic poem appeared itself (er). order reconstruct specifically northern version these folktale (er) the versions the scope could have heard and used his epic composition Tolkien put the text fairy tale first into old English and then translated into modern English the title (name the tale) also itself comes from the epic poem Beowulf and (er) Tolkien actually translated as wondrous tale is You know signifisent terms the wonder tale the particular folktale genre that gave birth the literary (er) fairy tale that all recognize today .Tolkien believed that his reconstructed folktale provided good solution many strange difficult and elements the epic poem (em) we will see the text the fairytale (name the tale) realized with the help complex specific linguistic means (er) started part the langua centric approach part the lingua centric approach have analyzed the texts (name the tale) using the the Irina Arnold's concept classifying the main categories linguistic means the fairy tale into two groups (er) there are expressive and descriptive means .so (er) the first group descriptive means are represented variety expressive means syntactic constructions that you can see the slide (er) that they enhanced the expressiveness speech speak about the oral tradition itself and they are also important components the compositional organization the fairy tale (er) and you see speech formulas (er) play the most important (er) role the text the fairytale and is very interesting see that speech formulas usually begin (er) with once upon time one day time the second group represented some speaking name that can find the text the fairy tale (er) they .(mm) combine with other stylistic devices such comparison hyperbola and irony items and create (er) vivid and memorable images characters the fairy tale (mm) you can see for example the main (er) character the fairytale (er) Beowulf there are some kind variation the writing we (er) read (er) the fairytale (er) we read fairy tale but while you will get the logic Beowulf the mix role for bear and the wolf and can make as bear finally and for example ..(er) with the help hyperbola see that Beowulf very strength and is really associated with strong bear for example his strength was that thirty having examined the main expressive and descriptive means and their function the text Tolkien's fairy tail (name the tale) who through the principles oral tradition can really say that these linguistic features play important role author's reconstruction oral tradition the form prosaic text and the study gives the opportunity better understand the writer's (er) intent and provides the basis for further translation talking fairytale into the Russian language (er). thank you much for your attention and you have questions you are welcome ask.. talking fairytale into the Russian language thank you much for your attention and you have questions you are welcome thank you very much ..any questions understand (er) how the (name the tale) how relates Beowulf you said will never mind will explain to you fact (name the tale) (er).so to say prequel the epic poem Beowulf because Tolkien himself added some new episodes for example (er) how Beowulf grew what were his first feast and first for example swimming competition (er) these episodes (er) can't found the epic poem that's why is some kind say prequel pre saga it just does not cover the gap that have that takes place between the two parts beowulf well to say covers both parts the epic poem but.(er) while you read the text you will really see that is fairytale because (er) Tolkien (er) added some new (er) characters that (er) with Beowulf the the another so= country help the king and they they help kill Grandal help survive so not no= not exactly prequel but rather extended version the original and and the cover yeah yeah the version that yeah that yeah that could passed orally along before the .epic poem itself appeared ..just attempt do that when ypu mention the author's intent the conclusions what it well (em) first time was very interested (er) why Tolkien decided write some kind fairy tale (er) that can that that that was connected with (er) Beowulf itself and found some sources that (er) showed (er) difference different purposes (er) this writer that was really he really (er) liked Beowulf(er) (er) Beowulf influenced Tolkien very much and and to say want see the maybe part the ideal style the writer comes like h= he= here you biographical writer's intention right not for example internal right not the not the not the the fairy tales intention text that's his yeah II was interested Tolkien's notes letters and what wanted reference reconstruct discover according the studies Beowulf the epic poem I was trying connect the title your research with which you were speaking about was thinking about why for example hyperbole means reconstructing oral tradition (er) is only part my research work it yeah and is just the beginning it because will have really very detailed research and the future(er) but anyway as (er) Tolkien (er) wanted show how oral tradition worked (er) long ago thought that the text could have found some items that can (er) really useful order express oral tradition yeah You see as text but we imagine that is wasn't text all it like you know poem (er) just oral information that you have and you want pass from one person another fully agree with that what mean (er) well particularly for example hyperbole feature an oral tradition one that makes so oralistic question  just also was wondering there source that you used identify some these means right characteristic oral tradition (em) it based some research it based your analysis based comparison of this fairy tale you for how you this list features it actually (mm) based Tolkient's (er) notesso and while have (er) Ddt all have fairytale and secondly have lot folklore element folklore element that can find the text and moreover can based somehow oral tradition ther= there very yeah there very complicated question answer but well right and mean things your slides like speaking comparisons what your motivation what you are claiming somehow representative tradition will you agree that not every descriptive means every expressive means exemplifies orality yes would agree but yeah (er) oral tradition like basis for research and for Tolkien but yes course is yeah it real fairy tale and has have already said lot hyperbolas irony alright (mm) are there any instances when well where the teller this fairy tale (mm) addresses the audience Because if you talk about about somebody who pretends be talking living person figure bard yeah as know oral tradition usually based alliteration some kind things but these texts don't have alliteration all and all we speak about (mm) oral tradition and fairy tale the combination them will see only (mm) repetitions for example (er) three months month some kind tautological repetition that can call Russian and speech formula that really organized the text one day once upon time time and on alright thank you
