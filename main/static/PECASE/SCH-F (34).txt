 thank you for your nice presentation my question would could you give any general recommendations for other health centers what's from your case could applied other health centers maybe not student health centers but other health centers improve people awareness different health issues 
 okay nowadays most health centers publish the information only about vouchers about the organization not some useful habits which people can use their real lives think that health centers needs pay more attention useful information their social networks like some tips some information about healthy lifestyle and on 
 thank you 
 you mentioned that social networks should used the right way but you think is possible control the use networks how people can use in the right way 
 maybe depends users because everybody changes what want see what want do the social networks depends users
