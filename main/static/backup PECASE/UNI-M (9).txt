well. speak here please. yes. well. this is a kind of recorder don't touch it.. well
it's ok.. (er) can you just... O K... (er) so. (er) good afternoon. everyone. (er) I did a research. about. artificial intelligence.. (er) what I'm going to. present today is actually still. only in its early stages. but. I really suppose tha=. suppose that my findings. so far. are still worth to tell you.. (er) artificial intelligence is a machine intellect. which is different than there (er) than the natural intelligence of the humans and other animals have.. moreover. A I. is the. (er) researches (er) that help. the environment. and the industry. so that they could work faster and grow rapidly.. (er) people seem to be either excited. or worried about the future impact of artificial intelligence.. personally. I can understand both points of view.. I. fascinated by developments in artificial intelligence. and (er) say at the same time. apprehensive about its possible negative effects.. (er) so. and all of us. know that. every technology has. its benefits and its drawbacks.. but advantages of the technology (er) advantages of the technology. always outweigh (er) the disadvantages to survive in the market. and (er) nonetheless. for artificial intelligence. we are not sure whether. in the long term period (erm) are positive effects will always outweigh the negative ones.. (er) O K. (er) so. let me start by looking. at some. advantages.. and this slide. You can see some real life (eh) real life artificial intelligence examples. (eh) on the one hand. the increase in. intelligence of technology should bring some obvious benefits.. machines are clearly able to do many jobs better than humans can. especially in areas. (er) that require. high levels of ac= of accuracy or. calculations using large amount of data.. in. for instance. (mhm) a large amount of robots have already been developed. that can carry out surgical operations and. procedures with greater precision than a human doctor.. (eh) and. all of us know that. we already have self-driving cars (er) just. for example. a Tesla ca= a Tesla car.. (eh). yes. and (erm). such technologies can. (er) improve safety. by. (eh) reducing the likelihood of human errors.. and. it is easy to imagine how these developments and many others will steadily improve our quality of life.. but. (er) of course. there are some weaknesses. of such. unique technology. as an A I.. (erm) on the one hand. I share the concerns of people who. (er) who believe. that. (er) artificial intelligence may harm us. if we are not. be careful.. in the short term (er) it is likely that we will see a rise. in unemployment rates. (er) as workers in various industries (er) are replaced by machines. or robots.. for example. self-driving vehicles. (er) may cause. redundancies. in. (erm) in driving jobs such as. taxi drivers. (eh) lorry drivers and. for instance. bus drivers.. (erm) if you took about a medium term fear (er) we have to say that. (er) if intelligent. technologies gradually take jobs away from humans (er) we may find. (er) that. people. (er) will lose the sense of purpose in life.. and. a longer term fear. is that computers become. so intelligent. (er) that they begin to make decisions without. human. oversight.. and some words about artificial intelligence. investments.. (eh) humans are focused. on the A I. because. they understand and know. that robots can give them. (mm) benefits and make task performance easier for them.. there are. a lot of companies (er) who are investing in A I technologies.. so. O K. following graphs and various data. about. I T companies  (er) which are focused and paying attention towards. the (er) artificial intelligence technologies (er) yes. that's the idea. and as you can see by the graph (er) just for the first column. (er) there are about (er) two hundred and fifty three companies. for. machine learning. and just for instance the second column. (er) there are. about. one hundred and fifty. four. companies. which are investing in artificial. in artificial (er) intelligence technologies.. (er) O K.. and (er) we are very close to the end. now. but. there are. just. a couple of things. that. I want to cover and. tell you.. (er) so. you have to understand from my speech the main conception and the idea. that. A I is a combination of mathematical analysis and. (er) (mm) and. (mm) learning. and all learning algorithms. fo= focused on planning and forecasting.. so. now I want to. (eh) show you my project (er) which was written on the. programming language. Python.. this project called. (er) Football. and it's (eh) a short video . if it will be work.. I will it hope that.. please. please. (eh) (er) please. work. work. no.. it's. small. oh. my God
change the program.. change the program. change the  instead of (er) Windows (er) Media Player. change it 
but it is. it is time cons= consuming and that gets. delay a lot of participants. but what I. have to do.. I want to present . O K.. and (er) it's really pity.. this project called Football.. and. this program. according. maybe. we can... can I show maybe on your computer. not. it's just
a bit later. now  (er) your presentation
but  without video. because it is. th= a last part of my presentation.. so. (er) O K. (mm) this program. it is program. according to my opinion. is a good example of. simple artificial intelligence.
and as I. as I have already mentioned that. (er) artificial intelligence is a combination of. mathematical analysis and predictions. based on the previous experience. (er) I used these approaches. in my program.. and they yes I. (mm) wrote two tactics.. the first one was for goalkeeper. and the second one was for attacker player.. and (er)
can you show maybe (mhm) no
maybe I .. I think. it would be. quick.. just because. the video is. for. it is. twenty.. seconds.. ... ... yeah. it works.. it's. good.. right... O K.. see if you can. .. yeah. it wasn't. it wasn't (er) so it wasn't so easy as you can imagine just. because. I have to. (er) have to. predict and forecast future movements. of my. opponent.. and to. write. a. a proper. a proper algori= a proper functions to. to predict the. their movements and. on this  I wrote. two tactics for. (er) goalkeeper and for attacker player. and. . it's .. yes.. (er) so and. what I have to say in conclusion. (er) (er) the. in conclusion. while intelligent machines will no doubt improve our lives. in many ways.. the potential risks of such technologies. shouldn't be ignored.. and (er) thank you for your attention.. feel free to ask any questions.. sorry for this (er) (mm) problem this. technical
ok.. the questions
yes.. please
(er) so. as I understand. you are in the first course of (er) Business Intelligence.. here. right... O K.. (er) I would say that.. as.. to criticize. you know.. and. believe me when I say. everything. everything. every word that I'm going to say is for you.. you can do better.. I can say that your presentation was very good. but what I want from someone who is specialising. in business intelligence.  so. I want you to be an excellent. presenter. first of all. the movement. the movement. you should like. move. better.. you are not good. O K. just move (er) you know. know your perimeter. and. know. where. like. where to look. O K you just was focusing on. on  like 
but. but my teacher
I know. I know.. you were presenting just for you.. just let me. let me speak and then. I I'll give you all the time like
so so the idea is that my teacher has. told me that. I have to communicate with the audience. and to see not just not one  directions. in. several directions and. I did. in this way. I did. like that my views was like  ok. ok
your presentation as I said. and your language. was really good. one of the best. students that I've. spoke English with. and I've listened to. because you were on (er) same (er). I O T. Internet of Things
yes Internet of Things
and (er) for. the record.. if. and only if. you practice forth. I think that by. year or two. you would be one of the best presenters . one of the best.. and and I give you. really. like. big plus. for the (er) video. that you did. cause. I know exactly it's exhausting to go about such a thing
yes it was really difficult and complicated 
and there another.. just one thing. usually. we try. methods in presenting. like methods.. you can. I can give you my idea since you are really listening  you know movie of. Johnny Depp.. (er) it was. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
yes of course
and you will. O K why is he speaking about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory because of. the fear that you. said you spoke about. at the end of your presentation. you said that. O K we are. we are going to face. maybe. an unemployment. problem  so. it's right but. human being. evolve. human being. develop . so as the father of the. the. you know  the main character of. the Chocolate. Chocolate Fabric. his father. became. not the operator of this machine. he became. (er) with like. someone who maintain this. this kind of machine. so human being. developed themselves.. and this is the way that we are going to. survive.. O K. thank you very much
well. any questions. on the topic of the presentation.. any.. so is it really possible to trust artificial drivers.. I wonder
(eh) can you repeat please
well. is it really possible to trust. artificial drivers.. a robot is artificial driver
(er) so. (er) this technology (er).. (er) isn't so. spread today. today. it's just. develop. and maybe. in the future. (er) we will (er) we will stumble upon this technology. as just (er) go outside and see self-driving machines. but for example. in Perm and. in and. in similar. cities. we. I think (er). will not. we will not see this technology like. self-driving cars.. these technologies. u= you. you've seen.. I think in local areas. today. and of course. it will be danger to trust. to trust these technologies (er) we. have to work. we have. we have to. work a lot of (er) we have to. work a lot to. develop to.. improve. these technologies to trust them
thank you
your research is in applied camp.  just to apply to. sports industry (er) well. what is the practical implication. of. this particular program. is it a first step. of creating more and more. or (er) can you. apply it. right now maybe to. something else. not only predictions of their. steps  somewhere else
it's really interesting question.. how to answer.. maybe.. maybe. maybe. in some sphere you can use. these. these algorithms. and these. theory. (er) just for example. (eh) in the medical sphere.. for example. I I read the article (er) in which. in which. was. written. something about that. (er) in robots. we implement some programs. and the. basis. illnesses. of our patients. and according to some. thesis statements. we (er) we. we. do a conclusion. and understand the diagnos=. diagnos=. yeah. for the patients. and. I think. it is a good idea to u= to use this approach not only not only in football but in the other spheres
do you envisage. the perspective of your research.. what is it.. would like to continue
(er) perspectives (er)
yes
you know. it's really. interesting topic. and I really interested in machine learning. big data. like data science. and. my. my. jo= my. work is. I did a literature review on this. work also. I did. yeah. and.. maybe yes. I will work on this
O K.. thank you.. thank you that's great
maybe I delete this video. just in case.  

if it. if it. crash your computer
it's not mine. it's High School of Economics
yeah
thank you
