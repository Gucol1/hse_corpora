research work the reflection the battle the Somme original Russian and British newspapers the aim this research work the analysis the reflection this event original Russian and British newspapers comparison with the reality from the witness's point view in order achieve this goal put forward several tasks first all made comparative analysis the British printed materials reflecting the beginning the battle tro= tried do the same with the Russian printed materials then compared them and revealed the common and different features and all all try analyze what was all made for be more precise need distinguish that the study this issue within the battle the Somme will able understand how much significant and urgent was for two different countries the allies who these countries counterparts payed more attention such powerful weapon the periodical press and the like the same talking according the scientists exactly this battle considered be the key point that turned the war back into the opposite direction and which finally compelled the Germans cave therefore different resources can also named sometimes the mighty grave the German field army in order analyze this situation visually first all need take glance the fragments which made the witnesses the first one you can see the slide was made the general serge was one the fighters during the World War . here there the continuation here can see that the first July was serious enough for the British the tragedy the day underlined the same (er) also can see some words about the small aims gained the British the next note was made the German historian also points out that the battle was out control since the very beginning and therefore did not very well all in accordance with this announce can point out that the battle was did not very well all still here can look take glance how the ge= how the British press covered ... this the news taken from The Daily Express here can see the read the success the British soldiers ... also the many ways concern the captives made the British the next news taken from the newspaper Daily Chronicle generally the depiction the events the same the same positive tone the happiness and the last British newspaper taken under analysis Guardian here can also read about the advance the British soldiers all all can point out ... that the main impact these newspapers on the great results and success the Allied soldiers the ri= the way there the information about the great amount captures the meantime witnesses did not say about them all and the delay the information which you could notice lasted for two three days which can considered be the news tendence the next local newspaper taken under analysis Russian namely (er) this exactly this newspaper was chosen since itwas one the most leading and influential influential newspapers that time Perm gubernia first its edition with mass la= was released thrice week later was shortened and then nineteen nineteen was closed needless say that exactly this newspaper chosen since can considered equal the British ones aforementioned the first note of the twenty-nineth June unfortunately any evidence the first July are not conserved still here can also .read. about the heralds the battle ... the next note of the fifth July here can also read about the energy strength the Russian soldiers ... and the last note on the sixth July here are other remarks about the advance the Allied soldiers and undoubtedly has positive tone so is clear that nothing was completely safe from the factual error and people didn't have much choice terms how get the news but still here can notice that the newspaper fragments are distorted from the official reports the the witnesses besides there are many words concerning the success the Allied soldiers but the meantime with the sense maintains that did not very well all and the delay the information which you could notice also was one the tendencies and the particulars the battle are not given the news they are just omitted and perhaps deliberately according this have come the conclusion some conclusions the delay information (er) which you noticed was based the idea changing the content correcting exaggerating humiliating this and only then printing the the pr= the news the information represented has mainly the positive tone for instance can explained the idea raise the spirits the country both the rear and the front and the last but not the least conclusion that the periodical press and the press itself worked consciously the means decieving people order for the sake the main privilege class continue the work by analyzing all this can undoubtedly point out that the press was for the state ruled the country people's mind and therefore now there no wonder why the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George once said the editor Manchester Gardens Court 1917 the people knew may truth that the world would stopped tomorrow but course they don't know and can't know on all all have gained the aim our research work thank you for attention I willing answer your questions ... 
 you agree with David Lloyd George you think that the Russian blandly entry they had known what extent their soldiers needed their support and you think they know how bad was going they would have supported them even more perhaps lost all hope you think was productive that the newspapers completely lined the idea that it's all going great kind or you think the opposite would have happened they'd known then they might have got behind bit more support they'd known how bad was going
 you know the press has ruled our minds since the times immemorial and this why think course all just feel that the press lying don't believe that the if the country the people knew the truth the war would stopped but with all with what what sacrifices would would there really don't know definitely agree with them him 
 thank you very much
