 well thank you very much well great presentation you can stop okay well questions well you are welcome 
 thank you very much have just one question would like know your opinion this issue that may potentially affect not your study but any kind study any studies this kind how could you manage the problem that explicitly expressed feelings about one's motivation may not reveal true purchase motives because there are certain studies would say studies showing that for example when people buy ecofriendly cars dishwashers they state that they thinking actually about the ecology about nature but the true motivation might different the true motivation might career (em) achievements social links and others like being visible the society the things that people may not even aware themselves when making these decisions  
 thank you very much for question well wasn't analyzing the reasons why people buy some product because analyzing (em) the motives that advertisers put into the messages they sent yeah that's why don't know it's really relevant why people buy some product 
 okay now it's clear that it's other side thank you 
 thank you 
 okay well please 
 very nice presentation the way question about the target audiences for these products (em) you compare beauty products between (em) how those advertisements are perceived Russian and the audiences typically the woman are the target audiences these advertisements they are trying influence women making purchases how you think the things you considered such versatility efficiency product you think that the perception and the things that are measured are different between Russian and American man opposed woman 
 thank you for your question well think actually beauty industry Russia also uses advertizes products men well men Russia also use cosmetics and have found examples the advertisements that use men models wouldn't say mean yeah obviously don't know it's political question (em) yeah obviously feel like American man uses beauty products more often and beauty brands consider man more often wen they create advertisements 
 well was interesting for to see that self expression you called yes 
 yeah 
 well for russian advertising wasn't typical yeah 
 yeah was less typical 
 have you tried analyze the reasons for why because some for self-expression seems be one the main things well buy different products well beauty products would like express well ourselves 
 well didn't it's not part my research obviously but like opinion this (em) feel like Russia maybe makeup marketed mostly women who use makeup like nude makeup they to work general and feel like maybe America people use makeup express themselves more often don't know (em) think it's going change and think more advertisers will consider this motive the adverts 
 well think it's serious motive for many people okay tank you
