days the week,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
again would like,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
question first all,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
was really interesting,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
you i have,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
em are you,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
for example ,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
well any questions,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
for such interesting,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
such interesting topic,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
interesting topic and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
did you ask,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
mm  what,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
 what personal,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
picture thank you,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
zero waste programme,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
ecological situation the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
situation the planet,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
need say that,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
environmental problems the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
purpose my research,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
research to identify,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
and what can,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
what can done,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
people change the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the survey and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
poisoning the world's,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the world's land,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the world will,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
adopting zero waste,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the nineteen seventies,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
than two hundred,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
five years old,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
see that most,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
that most the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the respondents are,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
respondents are aware,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
russia and more,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
per cent abroad,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
improve the ecological,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
also can see,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
don't know anything,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
know anything about,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
found out the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the information that,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
also stopped using,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
stopped using plastic,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
using plastic bottles,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
which can used,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
thinking about the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
without plastic packaging,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
are not easy,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
i have come,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
i really satisfied,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
that zero waste,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
but now i'm,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
this topic erm,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
question well maybe,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
maybe it's not,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
would much more,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
much more convenient,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
erm and now,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
more let's say,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
interesting see how,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
this work and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
all the people,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
for example now,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
and it's not,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
time spending it,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
i think every,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
person can little,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
one hundred people,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the whole world,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the situation are,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
well your view,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
people joined this,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
this movement will,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the there are,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
they can make,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
but don't think,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
people are not,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
people think that,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
think that they,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
what they can,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
they can they,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
can they don't,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
difficult for them,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
them but that's,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
are not enough,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
fruits vegetables and,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
this way the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
where there are,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the content the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02

one which was,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
which was frozen,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
they were placed,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
were placed glass,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
from the obtained,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
data can see,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
difference the content,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the content anthocyanins,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
and the level,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
can explained the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
with the fact,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
see the list,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the slide thank,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
slide thank you,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
thank you um,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
future and this,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
one the things,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
for research and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
any side effects,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
and uh the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
erm it's not,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
it's not really,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
okay okay thank,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
you have chosen,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
you for question,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
from district and,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
they were uh,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
difference between them,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
between them and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
most difficult part,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
part your research,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
our work was,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
dear speakers and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
present you work,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
is known that,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
proteins lipids and,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
lipids and carbohydrates,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
and  and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
that was our,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
into water and,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
uh is not,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the enzyme catalase,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
one the fastest,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
and only one,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
which you can,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
besides there are,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the body the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
there correlation between,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
catalase activity the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
um they can,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
they can based,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
concentration hydrogen peroxide,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
and permanganate metric,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
analysis the analysis,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
two samples from,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
samples from each,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
from each fish,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
were carried out,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the catalase activity,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
concentration the proteins,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
um and the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
determine the concentration,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the equation the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
yeah you can,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
um after that,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
after that the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
activity the enzyme,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
results you can,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
was the highest,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
liver and the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
and the lowest,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
but for the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
our hypothesis was,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
can see here,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
we have found,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
are related the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
bodies while the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
activity catalase can,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
can help to,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
with help this,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
this with the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
early warning system,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the environment uh,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
your attention uh,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
can test our,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
yeah i guess,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
this enzyme um,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
um i guess,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
are some special,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
test the activity,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
with the medicine,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
our body and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
like that yeah,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
guess you can,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
guess can continue,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
can continue study,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
that are not,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
not connected with,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
one hundred thousand,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
which does not,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
they have different,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
research work was,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
and what the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the gastrointestinal drugs,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the ability bind,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
two more types,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the gastrointestinal tract,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
one hundred milliliters,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the solution for,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
five minutes and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
minutes and then,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
during this time,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the color the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
color the solution,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
based the data,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
has the highest,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
digestive organs uh,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
would like note,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
like note that,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
but did not,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
not depend the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
and the ability,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
is important know,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
responsible for the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the quality and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
order be able,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
hope that the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
all for your,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
 i'm student,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
and today i'd,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
for children with,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
city libraries and,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the material the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
concerning this topic,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
topic em sorry,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
and have found,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
many words and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
 here you,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
uh the methods,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
teaching english children,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the peculiarities the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
educational process for,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
for the education,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
become the basis,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
basis for the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
can come the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
is almost impossible,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
can deal with,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
them em ,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
em  the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02

you may see,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
may see the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
that teachers and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
should pay attention,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
and whether they,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
have conducted survey,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
conducted survey the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02

research you can,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
bottled water uh,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the content fluorine,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the screen you,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
that used our,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
used our research,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
and uh this,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
can conclude that,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
water the actual,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the actual amount,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
actual amount fluorine,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the water the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the question the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
because uh they,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
from the water,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01

reason why the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
but anyway er,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
this er for,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the kindergarten yes,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
yes so what,1928,2,0,16.38,0.0
movie er the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02

i'm and topic,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
social roles the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
and the one,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
they are the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
have idea about,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the age person,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
age person and,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
person and the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the number hours,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the impact the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
understand the meaning,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
shoes another one,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
can see your,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
results my work,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
from eighteen thirty,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
their social roles,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
other age groups,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
practically the same,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
can assume that,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
why we need,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
like the model,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
the reason this,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
social roles um,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
girl from the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the beginning my,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
my presentation the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
her social roles,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02

that can help,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
i can say,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the point where,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
are social roles,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
some questions about,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
about uh how,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the table and,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
some basic rules,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
i've already mentioned,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
can you show,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
on the slide,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
and then this,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
some kind correlation,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
between the profession,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
think that um,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
social roles because,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
you have more,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
and this can,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
you know more,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
you think more,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
think more you,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
times and you,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
less knowing worse,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
knowing worse thinking,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
people because they,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
about the presentation,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
you have mentioned,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
that the term,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
i can see,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
you have them,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the numbers the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
should estimate the,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
estimate the hours,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
thing when you,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
you are like,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
not really good,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
not your case,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
questions  okay,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
today want present,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
is not surprise,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
not surprise that,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02

main idea the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
also see some,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
throughout the whole,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
short story which,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
that's why most,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the left side,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
it's not something,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
used quite often,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
one more interesting,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
not bring the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
example double negation,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
was not unrealistic,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
which are also,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
one short story,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
possible think that,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the way er,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
other people ask,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
men and women,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
example there was,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
loves and hates,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
yeah would probably,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
begin with the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
but that's not,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
the story that's,1928,2,1,16.38,0.01
er used er,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
what does the,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
language well and,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
believe that this,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
this this kind,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
have already mentioned,1928,2,2,16.38,0.02
