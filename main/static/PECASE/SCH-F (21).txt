 good afternoon name I'm a student the eleventh grade the in report today would like consider the russian segment twitch cultural phenomenon and analyze (er) the way functioned their support during the first phase the covid-19 lockdown in research (er) used the original surface and started the statistical data this topic ... begin with twitch multi-genre entertainment platform that offers all people regardless gender age profession embody their creative potential ..according the main page twitch the main function this platform (er) the role communication tool between people order provide extensive content streaming twitch divided into game and non-game types the game type includes directly game playthroughs and e-sports events the non-game type usually means real-life streams includes six sections music talkshows sports travel and outdoors just chatting food and drink special events ... before the period self-isolation the Russian segment twitch was rather undeveloped (em) the game categories were top just chatting was quite unpopular besides most streamers were single broadcast without any cooperation only top russian steamers had good advertising offers but less professional streamers often took unfair contracts (er) advertise roulette games and lotteries the maximum online traffic rarely exceeded twenty thousand people ... the turning point for this platform and particular for its russian segment was the self isolation [X] during the first wave the covid-19 lockdown ... Joel Forester notes the article covid-19 lockdown leads twenty four per cent increase twitch viewership one engagement metric quantify twitch the total number viewers the stream which have seen sharp rise businesses close homeworking begins and full lockdowns have been implemented ... the audience the russian segment twitch has increased twice thrice the maximum online have reach one hundred thousand viewers and regularly the top streamers were watched broadcast forty fifty thousand people ...  such significant growth audiences (er) has been catalys= catalyst for many processes first all many talented creators found out about the platform and came it .. express themself and their creative potential ... noted above the social aspect for twitch not the main one then the dominant  communication between the participants the stream is the basis (er) for which the platform exists ... for the  best results streamers decided join groups (er) squads ... the common sense squad an association people connected similar views goals and preferences for example they conduct (er) steam broadcast exclusively the same format within the same category despite the fact that squads are special manifestation communication (er) which all three forms communication are possible between streamers and the audience separately between streamers and separately between audiences (er) the russian segment twitch (er) there are quite them (er) the most well-known (er) eighty-nine squad and freak squad ... would like elaborate one the most striking examples typical creative association the russian segment namely the activity the freak squad organized the streamer evelone192 known Vadim Kazakov late March and early April two thousand twenty ... today includes (er) thirty-three participants but the time the creation (er) there were only about six people including the organizer himself ... .. using his example can talk not only about the squad means communication between streamers but also means attracting more attention (er) less well-known (er) but less worthy streamers ... can mention not only the effectiveness there kind audience exchange but also about the humanistic nature this kind communication ... thirdly the increase the audience the successful entertainment platform during the lockdown also contribute development gender diversity which attracted attention larger audience as soon the number squads has increased significantly became possible expand each entertainment program The day was divided into three main shifts (er) between different streamers for example the first half the day conversation and entertainment streams such were allocated (er) the middle the day and its second half were devoted play-throughs and the evening was all about talk shows and various events were held parallel with the most massively viewed play-throughs the games such CS:GO Among Fall Guys etcetera group communication games among which mafia bunker and world domination (er) became very popular the just chatting category became the leading one which resulted the creation various podcasts such (er) blablacast created Dina Blin and the organisation of  joined views films series anime and cartoons ... addition the fact that the activities the squad attracted the attention many thousands people (er) companies also drew attention them advertising an indicator time has clearly manifested itself various forms streams from calling for the purchase real and virtual things using different online services such Yandex Dodo Pizza SkillBox etcetera and streamers thus acted media personalities and influences in conclusion I would like point out direct connection between (er) the decline the activity russian segment and the end the period lockdown the first wave covid-19 however even during the not long period the first wave one can analyse the way twitch developed an example just only one squad whose main activity was (er) april may two thousand twenty as result there appeared greater branching and complexity the structure the squat (er) like holding streams shifts the expansion the entertainment program for instance the appearance new categories and shows and course the increase the audience and (er) advertisers interested their activities ... thank you for your attention I'm ready answer your questions 
 well thank you hot topic indeed especially given the pandemic conditions and all the consequences thereof okay please you have any questions the speaker 
 is very very specific (er) social media and (er) I'm very excited that you have chosen twitch instead Instagram which more popular maybe clubhouse which appeared just now so why did you choose twitch mainly  
 (er) think twitch (er) the platform that gives you (em) feeling that you are connecting with all the (er) people and the streamer himself or herself (er) you can connect (er) the moment and (er) feels like you have friends and people (er) who can discuss (em) issues and different topics with you  
 yes but think that Facebook the same in this sense because also connects people and on ... but still it's very nice idea maybe is because twitch very narrowly segmented it oriented very particular audience as you have presented how you think does twitch effective for business and for which kind business twitch may mostly effective 
 yeah I think twitch affects business lot (er) because as said PR companies and businesses (er) understand that (er) streamers (er) strong inferences (er) and people can (er) can see and want buy something or use some services think  
 okay thank you thank you very much 
 I'm sorry cannot hear you 
 it's you're getting technical issues today but it's just natural talk about platforms right once again you did mention one point your report the humanistic side the platform now view that excuse of that consideration how you see the future such platforms do you think they are likely ultimately replace face-to-face communication is going be the other way around 
 (er) think (er) will an opportunity for people who can= cannot connect with their friends (er) be touch but don't think (er) that (er) will replace face-to-face connection because can (er) extra motivation meet people real life yeah 
 thank you very much indeed any other questions from the audience any questions from you please 
 sorry joined late
