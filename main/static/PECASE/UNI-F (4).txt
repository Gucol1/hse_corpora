good afternoon everyone name and I'm perm state university student and today the topic my speech the categorization loanwords obtained through the conquest the British isles English modern language product the long-lasting development which the language goes through different changes this research deals with the impact five main conquests the British isles the English lexicon and studies the Celtic the roman the Anglo Saxon the Danish and the Norman conquest the main sources vocabulary changes therefore our aims were study the borrowed words for each conquest identify the main spheres life through which the borrowings came the language and systematize the found data this research considered be relevant and topical (uh) because constitutes not only the collection data but its thorough analysis and sorting out (uh) but before even start have define the even term borrowing borrowing loanword borrowed word word taken over from another language and modified phonetic shape spelling paradigm meaning according the standards the English language this definition was taken from the book (uh) the English word Arnold (uh) who and this book was huge inspiration for presentation according the calculations there are around seventy per cent English words that were once borrowed from several different languages historically the Celts come first since the 10th century up the first century (uh) parts the British isles were inhabited the Celts and they were warriors who rapidly expanded their territories they had cultivate and look after the cattle and the city structures developed fast that all led the necessity giving the (uh) names the geographical places therefore the main impact the English language the Celts was (uh) made the area toponomy we include here geographical entities including names cities and villages and some most famous examples are Aberdeen Cardiff Dublin Edinburgh and Glasgow also here you can see the meaning the original word and hydro names for body water with such examples Avon Derwent Vesque and Loque (eh) but soon (um) the Celts were conquered the romans and during the period from the first century up till the fifth century the romans (um) managed leave decent print the English language before even start have distinguish two main periods the first period the period continental borrowings which happened before the Anglo Saxons settled down the British isles and second one was the period the standardization reason (uh) the first period continental borrowings (uh) here have two main groups was connected with trade including animals plants and foods with such examples lobster butter cherry pepper pound and blind and on and what's connected with domestic and household items such belt cap crop dish table soap pillow and on but obviously the most impactful all periods was the period Christianization Britain (uh) and now because this period and because Christianization all have such words connected with religion and church such altar angel candle nun pope song and temple words connected with education and learning such master school history and grammar and words denoting plants herbs and trees such bead seed a ginger plant radish rose and on (uh) (uh) and the beginning the fifth century the romans suffered frequent attacks from the barbarians and soon they had leave now have (uh) the Anglo Saxons (eh) four hundred and forty nine (uh) Germanic tribes the angles the Saxons and the Germans began settle down the third room British isles and here (um) it commonly believed that the Anglo Saxon set motion the essential British culture that's why most fundamental and commonly used words (uh) come exactly from these periods time such words such nouns water house food friends people family (uh) and such verbs believe leave fight make laugh wipe and on (uh) entered the language during that period also number adjectives (uh) articles pronouns numerals prepositions and even interrogative words came into the English language right because that period (uh) okay there one thing that want mention it commonly believed that curse words (uh) start appear language right the basis it (uh) when the cultural traits that particular nation are being born and we mentioned the Anglo Saxons I consider be the first (uh) people who were forming the British culture (uh) and national character that's why is not surprise that the majority curse words actually have the Germanic origin and is estimated that about eighty-five per cent the Anglo Saxon words gradually died out because the upcoming (uh) onslaught the Vikings and the Normans yeah have the Vikings coming next (uh) from the fifth century to the eleventh century the Viking raids brought another period disruption and war but anyway you know Anglo Saxons the Anglo Saxons and the Vikings they spoke sister languages old Norse and old English that's why here still have basic words everyday language (uh) such flat meek awkward weak spout skin leg neck freckle (uh) such verbs to score gasp to call seem want trust and on but which what important here (uh) it's nice it's important mention that the Vikings are known for their violent behavior and their violent culture found the way into the English language that's why English have words connected with war and battles such anger die gun kick (uh) knife ransack scathe slaughter scare and scream (uh) bit bit (uh). yeah (uh) the mentioned before the languages the Anglo Saxons and Vikings were quite similar and they could understand each other but gradually the ending support started disappear make the communication easier between the two people and that's why this process led the modern English where have (uh) gender and very few endings (uh) coming next we have Normans the ten sixty-six (uh) the Normans invaded the British isles and they made the new aristocracy and the Anglo Saxon people became their servants basically there were two different languages spoken the country the same time Norman French being the official language was the language that was spoken court and also is important mention that writing was hands the French scribes (uh) this the reason why English has such (um) many examples inconvenient spelling and pronunciation but can already establish that the Norman loanwords differ severely from the previous ones and considering the fact that French became the official language (uh) people people power is not hard understand that that's major changes in the language were connected with government and administration with the names titles ranks and feudal relations and with law and jurisdiction we have such words assembly authority government power servant and then the second group baron count duke feudal manor madame master and law and jurisdiction accused arrest it's only case cause court legal marriage money penalty and on (uh) having analysed having analyzed five main conquests can make the conclusions the Celtic borrowings left the biggest mark the area toponomy (uh) this happens because the fact that the Celtic conquest had more discovering character that's why have toponyms and names geographical entities the next conquest was much more important and greater quality the loanword field (uh) out all found groups loanwords the most relevant ones are words connected with trade because obviously the romans are known for trading and words connected with Christianity (uh) next have old Norse and old English red languages that came from the same proto Germanic roots and that's why (uh) borrowings from this period you are be the basic (uh) be basic and used everyday language well and is also estimated that around eighty per cent the first five hundred words commonly used words English language are old Norse old English origin and last but not least have the Normans the Norman conquest brought major changes the English language the loanwords the period are connected with governments and administration (uh) titles military terms feudal relations and law and jurisdiction that all that want say thank you much for attention now I'm ready answer all your questions 
thank you  
do you know why the English language has changed since the Normans 
 since the Normans 
 yeah 
 you mean loanword way just 
 yes you know any our future country
 well obviously after after the Normans have some well the English language has many different changes (um) the Shakespearean era brought huge impact the whole language then obviously it's still new words are still coming have like words from Arabic origins like I'm not mistaken something like tea something like that and then a origin culture like kangaroos I'm not mistaken yeah obviously language living organism and goes through changes we want to not yeah obviously has went through many different changes but I'm not (uh) can't really speak for that lot because specialization specialization about old English and what came before
