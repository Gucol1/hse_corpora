 is both big pleasure and privilege for to able speak you right now and in the language understood more than billion people across the world language prevalent that is completely dominating the fields . informational technology and economics and this English history turned out differently English would that in such big lingua franca our modern world and this why believe that various other tools across cultural communication should and can creative this why the topic my presentation Interslavic language ... Interslavic the constructed language unlike naturalistic languages evolving over the course human history constructed languages that created over relatively short period time for specific purpose they are mostly artistic created add flavour picture universe such elvish the lord the rings Interslavic an auxiliary language meaning is supposed promote communication between various people Slavic languages share long common history having been controlled small handful states and empires for the past centuries Slavs have developed a dialect continuum some parts Europe which means closest versions various languages are well understood the inspiration for Interslavic was modern standard literary Arabic a language used for politics and media by all Arabic speaking states regardless the the versions Arabic language similarity it Interslavic heavily based Old Church Slavonic the first literary standardized Slavic language is supposed be the linguistic center all Slavic languages understandable any Slavic speaker ... some works regarding needs usage and understandability existence Serbo-Croatian Czech and Polish (eh) information Interslavic Russian pretty scares and is known wide and is not widely known Russian audiences this why ultimately believe oops work report could of some use I started attempting calculate find what called linguistic distance the degree which languages differ from one another is difficult calculate objectively the linguistic distance when are not talking about natural languages involves studying effect language trade history studying additional languages the same language group since Interslavic created artificially this not possibility the first big problem stumbled upon and this was achievement my report. lack effective standardisation language mostly spoken internet people this spot people generally interpreted the way they wanted people's pre-existing preferences language affect their speech certain degree for example in their biggest Discord community for Interslavic there was history involved which all the changes big prominent and community made entire service language were documented this lack standardization grammar not issue however with vocabulary it's quite difficult story single word Interslavic can have multiple translations for instance little can translated nemnogo which the Russian form and trohu which the form more familiar Ukrainian and West Slavic speakers this means that any given conversation the little separation between various speakers the same language will still remain and it's difficult calculate exactly how different Interslavic from any given Slavic language attempted use the Swadesh list list the most common lexemes vital for translating text measuring linguistic distance when using the Swadesh list found that taken simply taken the synonyms which sound the closest Russian the the similarity between root words Interslavic and Russian close ninety seven percent however the most unfamiliar roots Slavic Russian speakers are taken get figure sixty seven percent which very big margin although the average eighty two percent my best guess objective valuations can not made from then for standard from one word moved to attempting ... (eh) evaluate the language understandability and subjectively have total twenty nine testees present them with six texts equal length topics such sports science well text from simple literary texts (em) unlike the case naturalistic languages the level perception written spoken Interslavic was close the same political and scientific texts were understood better (eh) the testees than non-scientific ones which can attribute the prevalence Greek and Latin loanwords them here little table you can have see the numbers that testees themselves gave how they understood the given texts ... several subjects noted that understanding Interslavic was similar them puzzle they have employ (eh) linguistic knowledge and linguistic thinking they get now meaning words from context this supported the fact that subjects more confident their foreign language ability and those who said they studied English for owner tended rather understanding the texts being higher average over the course (eh) the presenting testees with texts have also asked them questions what were the most obstructively unfamiliar parts the text them I found that many them struggled with orthography the general rules Interslavic orthography are follows (em) Interslavic can frighten both Latin and Cyrillic scripts and this important know that the letter represents the sound both these well the letters sh and such in check are also used Interslavic orthography ... the most vital grammar for Interslavic comprehension was that which was not found Russian the modal verb is still distant Interslavic it sended from old church Slavonic thus this verb conjugated person and number and often replaces the personal pronoun jesm jesmo jesi and on the detachable particle which Russian exists the postfix sia is also quite common can as understood from the title detached from its verb and moved the different position when seeing testees should attempt recognise the verb might attached in order fully grasp the meaning an example the quite simple javiti tensing more unfamiliar javiti when the particle detached ... words marked the testees are the following this with the most obstructively unfamiliar and uncommon which most the testees marked not abled understand most these are from West Slavic South Slavic languages and speak the nature Interslavic language the linguistic common words still the level understanding with pretty among the testees general potential value Interslavic and its use quite large can use for travel simple words simple constructions basic communication with any Slavic speaker for study the languages made large part slavists and is big introduction slavistics its (eh) availability understand Interslavic can also help learning any other Slavic language and Interslavic useful for presenting information can used address the entire Slavic world via websites forums and conferences without having translate the texts into several (eh) different languages such (em) experiments already being undertaken and remember their work quite successful ... this list sources that used ... generally (mm) Interslavic me seems like the most novel and the most successful addition the culture Interslavic pan-slavist=pan-Slavic languages my opinion which the goal for itself which being common tongue Slavs speaking each for understanding which very little dom that all
 
thank you very much that was very insightful report (erm) are there any questions from the participants ... (erm) not maybe later (erm) have myself couple questions because the topic seems quite interesting me I was bit confused about the (eh) states Interslavic constructed language does have the stable grammar and dictionary
 
(em) this Interslavic has (em) regulatory body the Interslavic commission which established its creators and they even have (eh) yearly Interslavic conferences which are commonly held well the grammar the language standardised (eh) the vocabulary seems be shifting because the process accepting new words and people language (eh) is follows algorithm which calculates what the most appropriate word use article Interslavic languages while the official version pro=provided the creators quite well standardised most materials you can find the web are created people and have (eh) lower degrees standardisation learning languages more difficult
 
right understanding correctly that this kind also user constructed language people contribute its body vocabulary
 
yes people can contribute the official web site creators have established there certain form you can fill which the word you are proposing fits all the criteria established will added dictionary this very collective project
 
thank you and I`ve got one think one very short question about the more practical part your research who were the testees
 
the testees were for the most part (em) classmates people from school people from extended family and parent's co-workers ranging the age (eh) seventeen believe about fourty eight
 
fourty eight cause thinking about the (eh) the relevance these (eh) group (eh) terms gender well what was the proportion
 
the proportion (em) don't precisely remember but believe was more female than male because most my classmates are female would say there bit form tip the scale
 
yeah then what about the proportion people let's say under the age twenty
 
well under the age twenty (em) believe about (em) fifteen about half (eh) let .. find the right (em) seventeen testees were the people from school and classmates and the rest were the members extended family and co-workers
 
I see gender bit disproportion to it
 
yes obviously we can see this graph for example this quite bumpy the sample sizes not digging to actually but the reason underlined trend which can noticed and intend conducted research contribute the community this project

thank you are there any other questions 
 
 thanks for the presentation can see the graph more time right am right that you are measuring how confident your respondence were that they understood the texts Interslavic correctly
 
yes
 
yeah did you anyhow (em) well did you somehow also measure whether they actually understood the text are you just measuring the self-reported confidence are talking about people really understanding the texts are just talking about people thinking they understand these texts
 
(eh) it's actually subjective initially intended create some sort (eh) quiz survey that would let see how well understood the (em) the meaning each particular sentence but realized that this not (eh) that's not accurately represent here see subjective perception (eh) which (eh) intended goal people with higher general scores tended underline less words and less parts the text being difficult for them this general me general mark for that some sort correlation between actual understanding and subjective understanding exists
 
right (em) just you want continue your project further think this the promising part it you may want still somehow take look the actual comprehension the texts because teacher can tell you that is quite open the case that student person believes that they comprehend piece text piece oral speech and the reality later turns out that was you know mixture miscomprehension and accurate comprehension although self-report valuable and gives you some information think that you want the direction seeing whether people actually well did get content from the text that was there and not that they thought was there that could help your project just minor comment and another thing that want ask when you were (em) working with respondence did you get any feedback from them about how they felt about with this engagement with text Interslavic what there was response did they find interesting fascinating baffling this something that you know maybe something that you want to
 
oh yes well several them commented actually the language sounds close Old Church Slavonic (eh) many said that seemed like parody old Russian when reading this text have heard the jesm czar words from (eh) professions list for times many found silly funny many people also found eh engaging remember quite few the testees remarking well they said yeah that understanding was sort puzzle (em) little interesting mental task because some the words sound quite different from Russian even those share common root (eh) generally the testees who were apathetic probably did not take test because while (eh) testing them verbally also sent several testing forms (eh) believe that people who did engage for testing initiative were quite interested these tests
 
thank you mean (em) think would also interesting study this because your last slide you mentioned the value and the use Interslavic and the value and the use Interslavic would depend whether people are ready are willing use and is sort would interesting look whether people really have interest whether people are ready do something like this even obviously you know close their native language some might more into some might less into so this action also something worth studying thank you
