 and now (eh) think are ready proceed our next speaker our next presentation be given (eh) who going give (eh) the micro macro sorry macroanalysis Mark Zuckerberg's model the metaverse (eh) 
 good afternoon 
 yes you can begin 
 want tell you about project (eh) the macrodynamic analysis the Zuckerberg's metaverse one can either confirm refute the hypothesis that have all been living the digital universe for long time since the days the matrix this ideas have delighted and thrilled mankinds throughout the world it's only the now the virtual world has been officially declared space for life was Mark Zuckerberg who has claimed its among others ladies and gentlemen welcome the metaverse metaverse new space with its inhabitants principles and shared values but when and how will be able start functioning why isn't working now answer these questions conducted macrodynamic analysis Mark Zuckerberg`s metaverse model the purpose our research to predict the possibility the extents the metaverse social world do this have identified the features sh social macrodynamic processes the metaverse that are similar the characteristics the real world Emile Durkheim his book sociology its subject matters and purpose identifies three interrelated microdynamic processes that form society the process increments (eh) is process population concentration the differentiation the process deviding phenomena and groups into constitute parts according certain characteristics and the integration the process unification and convergence in order function properly all these processes should interconnected do this users the metaverse must least compete for resources interact with each other form subgroups and mobilise power let focus these processes particularly (eh) the process increments likely be done using Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and various internet platforms alike the real worlds the population the metaverse doesn't depends the nature population growth but separator the technological worldview the citizens overall well-being and the quality the internet connection their area the differentiation process divides users into separate groups gamers businessmens programmers and buyers form their own subgroups which are more divided professional and personal skills and interests the integration process (eh) depends the ability subgroups compete for resources and mobilize power but this stage the development the metaverse cannot offer resource that users can fight for (eh) this there no competition for resources there no integration process what's another way while the subgroups the ritual social worlds have nothing share they don't make unions and (eh) they don't make unions ... there direct waste consolidate and extends ideological and physical space speaking about cryptocurrency for instance any investor (eh) can invest (eh). can create its own vision cryptocurrency and destroy anytime (eh) thus the level trust the virtual worlds not high that users rush accumulate virtual resources (eh) however predict increase the level trust the metaverse (eh) because (eh) people can (eh) believe their close companions and friends (eh) can concluded that due the low solidarity the lack the mobilization power and competition for resources Zuckerberg's metaverse model cannot yet called social world (eh) since the connection between macrodynamic processes broken addition the process integration subgroups the social world always associated with symbolic communication and single ideology otherwise individuals have nothing unite for nowadays only few people know about the metaverse even though investors are ready invest millions dollars this new space (eh) may suggest (eh) huge technological progress waiting for soon the metaverse likely be our inevitable future with helps humanity will move new stage evolution thank you for your attention that's all 
 thank you for this great talk about (eh) metaverse you said that only a few people know about metaverse today looks like I'm not among them this why I have some questions (eh) well speaking about metaverse being the inevitable future the humankind could you please just name some potential applications this technology 
 (eh) the metaverse new space and (eh) for (eh) this space this space can function with (eh) technological progress and (eh) for this (eh) different companies must least (eh) unite and (eh) expands our technological knowledges together 
 yes and as like ordinary person how can benefit from this technology 
 (eh) benefits technologies 
 as like university teacher for example how can benefit from 
 (eh) you can (eh) communicate with the students from different countries galagramms (eh) use special glasses for (eh) see the more area and you can see (eh) whole classroom with classmates and interact 
 sounds great sounds really great. thank you thank you well please more questions 
 have question 
 okay 
 your work very interesting and now want know what did your research give you exactly 
 (eh) provide microsemic analysis and (eh) helps to understands why the metaverse doesn't work now (eh) must admit that I chose this topic for research for research due once have played one game its name Detroit. and that game (eh) has got parts the metaverse was very exciting for and interesting 
 thank you 
 thank you more questions please 
 can . how can you (eh) how you think (eh) what are the risks the development the metaverse 
 (eh) it's interesting note that the metaverse can function properly (eh) our real worlds maybe stop (eh) people stop use real worlds need face-to-face conversation 
 your sound (eh) off 
 yes it it better now 
 better 
 okay 
 (eh) there are many risks for example for society people needs face-to-face conversation and (eh) we don't have real conversation (eh) and will spend more time the metaverse just lose our reality 
 have question for you really great job I wondering the metaverse expands and becomes something that more people are familiar with you think that will become something that governments care about and want have control or you think will independent forever 
 speaking about governments I (eh) didn't think about this topic but . wanted say that the metaverse must (eh) don't must have governments because it has has got government. appears (eh) new (mm) it's doesn't appear new platform for free (eh) conversation and living (eh) believe that governments will not know about this new space 
 thank you thanks
