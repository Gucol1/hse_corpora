hello everybody (er) it's pleasure welcome you today. (er) let introduce myself I'm first-year student economics and today will talking about the effectiveness using (er)[brief] optic fiber the public fire safety systems (er) from the beginning (er) I'd like point the fact that there are lot that there lot literature about the application optic fiber sensors but there are researches about the use optic fiber the public fire safety system conducted study analyzing (er) the possibilities using this technology at factories and setting the feasibility introducing in the fire safety system pu= public places have divided presentation three fa= into three parts first will describe the alternative fire safety systems and explain why using the optic fiber more efficient (er) compared the (er) existing fire systems second I will talk about the way (er) implementation the proposed idea third will present the results have received and will draw some conclusions (er) start with I will talk about the fire safety syste= the (er) two fire safety systems the first one the most common signalization which installed all public places (er) the principle simple open fire causes smoke (er) smoke disturb laser inside (er) this device and sets off alarm there are main weaknesses such technology one major drawback (er) only detects fire but does not help prevent the emergency moreover often triggers false alarm for example (er) deodorant may disturb laser last but not least these system (er) these systems are economically inefficient compared the alternative that propose (er) now let describe you how optic fiber sensor works heating leads the optic fiber deformation (er) the specializer detects and collects information about the deformation the fiber and send this information the computer with special app (er) the computer analyzes and creates graph (er) the fiber might deformed any kind physical pressure (er) the equipment should (er) configured the something specific for example (er) find temperature (er) now (er) let show you some numbers (er) this table shows that optic fiber safety system requires two elements instead 10 required the ordinary system another point that optic fiber system fifty per cent cheaper (er) this part my presentation will focus the practical implication my study propose crowded places places with optic fiber sensors for constantly temperature monitoring (er) is necessary stretch the fiber near the large number wiring and powerful electrical appliances information about the temperature changes (er) (er) will set= sent the specially equipped computer their security post somewhere else (er) like (er) is illustrated this slide let simulate the situation in the first case look the school with ordinary detect= (er) detectors wiring starts heating and causes fire signalization detects smoke and sets off alarm students and teaching staff evacuate the building breathe gases and (er) school suffers from the fire in the second case use optic fiber fire= fire safety system (er) the school and the situation are the same so wiring starts heating (er) optic fiber safety system detects (er) this (er) temperature and sets off ararm alarm.. somebody de-energises school and prevent fire (er) these observations allow to come the conclusion that (er) modern ways fire safety system have list weaknesses which may avoided (er) using optic fiber source fire safety optic fiber sensors cannot only detect but also prevent fires prevention emergency situation will save money and priceless human lives in future investigation= (er) investigations might possible expand the research (er) .. find other technologies (er) and the better solution the current problem and now will happy answer all your questions ... you may have
 sorry ... okay thank you very much indeed for your report please do you have any questions our first reporter ... any questions from the audience please ... okay ... have question you don't mind can you hear me 
 yes course 
 okey you have mentioned this your report but (er) could you once again highlight the economic implications replacing ordinary fire safety systems with fiber optic systems you did mention they were more economical  
 sorry sorry (er) I have some problems (er) please can you (er) 
 repeat question okey can you hear now 
 yes can 
 that's . okey once again you did mention this your report but (em) could you please highlight again the economic implications replacing ordinary fire safety systems with fiber optic systems (em) you did say they were more economical but assume they are more technically advanced they could more expensive well it econo (technical breakdown)  
 you can (er) okay (er) this technology more expensive course because is modern and requires lot work (er) especially scientific work but this system consists only from (er) two elements (er) we spent (er) big amount money only for the sensor but do not need for example fire detectors we don't need ... crash walls (er) equi= equip the place (er) with this system so all these points make this system more econo= economically efficient 
 thank you so we we may assume long-term savings ... great thank you for your answer please dear audience any more questions our reporter please 
 just moment I I turn off mobile was very nice presentation thank you ... well economic effects and safety but what I'm interested is the fact that (er) you want change (er) your fire (er) alarm system for example you have some more costs (er) connected the refurbishment (er) and (er) order change the system and this what you not take into account does that mean that your recommended approach (er) applicable only the new buildings
 course (er) ... (er) this idea may face some problems with (er) for example law (er) because (er) somebody doesn't know about this and (er) there were tests (er) this sphere but (er).. can use (er) this system together with (er) the ordinary system to feel more secured and prevent more situation and course for new buildings (er) is much easier (er) keep (er) keep keep new buildings with such technology but old buildings (er) ... old buildings may used too for example together with (er) the ordinary system
will be more less expensive 
 (er) we speak about (er) new buildings course will less expensive because won't  need buy the old way fire safety system ... (er) ... the old safety system (er) but for the old buildings maybe will (er) mean (er) extra money we will need extra money equip (er) the public place with something new something extra ... but will save money future if the emergency situation will happen... will prevented ...  not detected but prevented so will save much more money 
 yeah okey thank you very much
