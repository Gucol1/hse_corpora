 next (er) report will be by (speaker name) allogism as a feature of Jonathan Safran Foer style on the example of short story here we are so quickly   so yes good afternoon dear colleagues as I have always been introduced My name is (speaker name) this year I'm graduating from our Perm State University and today I would like to show you some results of my research work on the topic of alogism as a feature of Jonathan Safran Foe style I've analyzed alogismand on the example of the short story  on so quickly so on the whole way or  a developmental linguistics form some various connections with other sciences (er) including logic which is very close to exact sciences Initially in the antique time logic was based on three subjects which were mathematics(er) philosophy and grammar and for Middle Ages linguists and philologists studied the problem of language and mind and nowadays philo= philologists usually explore how some logical (er) categories are expressed by means of different languages so among common terms being logic  in logic and linguistics there is such term as alogism. philosophy defines alogism as illogical judgment which breaks the rules of logic or effects that can't be explained with logic in literary studies alogism is seen as a stylistic mean which presupposes some violation of logical rules or some logical connections in the text some variations of alogism are seen on  are presented on the slide which are a logical break between phrases or parts of the dialogue
it could be a position of objects and features that have nothing in common or destruction of causal relations as well as meaningless arguments alogism and serves as a base for many stylistic devices and figures of speech such as   oxymoron   and others coming to this kind of research (er) this report aims to present the results of research of alogism as a feature a key feature of Jonathan Safran Foists style. actually Jonathan Safran Foist is a contemporary American writer he's most renowned novels are everything is illuminated and extremely loud and incredibly close although (er) pre last year if I'm not mistaken he published his last novel here I am .and according to this story he answered quickly it was published in New York in 2010 it's composed of similarly restructured sentences (er) which are not explicitly connected with each other each sentence characterizes one of two main characters in the short story and presents some (er) some of their everyday lives and duties so the short story is like he's some kind of it In a collage like ways gives us an insight into a man woman relationship way from the beginning to marriage than having a child getting old and at last dying we analyzed the story on three levels concerning level of ideas the deepest one then (er) the level of images (er) which reflect some ideas expressed through the text and then come into the kind of surface level of verbal expressions (er) so on the level of ideas the deepest ones the short story has different had several contradictory ideas for example the first one you can see (er) is that here that's life and marriage in general is not some polar thing we can say that life is totally good or totally bad as well as marriages so instead it's seen as some collision and combination of happy and unhappy moments knowledge and absence of knowledge success and failure then we can see some combination of two opposite ideas which are that everything is constantly changing so there's the idea of non-convertible changes (er) yes you can see the example here that I changed and changed and with more time I will change more and actually nothing you can do with it and at the same time we see some sentences which prove the idea that we can't change anything like and here we aren't so quickly (er) everything else happens why no the thing that could have .and the last but probably not least (er) there are some ideas actually of empiricism presented in the novel (er) I'll try to prove it (er) so verbs and other the words which express feelings emotions some attachment senses they are more often given in their formative forms like I was some tired of food you laughed reimposed  I hated our bed meanwhile those elements which characterized some cognitive processes thinking memory (er) often obtain negative connotation or they are used in the negative forms like I was always hearing my father's voice senses but never remembering his face or you didn't know where  were or the what do I remember the more distant I feel
so yes we can suggest that the author or the character (er) shares views of empiricism so they believe life cannot be (er) perceived and understood by means of logic thinking cognitive processes in general and also principles of empiricism which include inductive way of judgment if you remember some philosophy it's a way of judgment but to move from particular to general to some general conclusions and in the short story it is cause it also can be seen so (er) the short stories made by enumerating some facts on some details of lives of character which are then kind of generalized in the last paragraph if you're interested I can so I can share it with you later so key ideas are expressed then in images (er) some of them include images of a home or house which corresponds quite strongly with the main idea of the no of the short story also we see some images of Godyn which is quite interesting and also reinnervation so restoring house through these images (er) also conveys the ideas of changes again and the ability of change (er) some adaptation ideas probably (er) and there is also a compound metaphor which  spans throughout the whole short story which is a metaphor of life as a journey you see these quotations like why foreign cities came to me so much to me I have always never been here (er) the author or main character probably thinks in a categorical way that's why most of images are in the form of categories which are the most general versions because you then hear on the left side of the slide thus we see images of happiness knowledge success love which also have their opposites formed by means of negation so (er) for love have hatred for them to have immobility etc (er) then these are categorical character of images are displayed in language in various ways (er) firstly in multiple usage of adverbs of time such as always never it is the second kind of line here the first is absence of logical connections you may look at examples and understands (er) yeah the second about adverbs of time like (er) always never usachev usage of such pronouns as everything and nothing so you see it's not something (er) it's not today it's not tomorrow it's not two pm it's always and never also there author used quite often the adverb just which makes characters words sound a bit like an excuse so I was mostly just joking or you we were always awful at estimating and so on so far also we see some cases of matching elements with opposite meanings here we come too real alogisms in the language so we were always never mentioned in it or you tried only nothing there also actually loves these collocation always never very much he uses it for about 15 or 16 times in the short story which is quite quite short story then we have a position of non opposites elements like I was not afraid of being let alone I just hated it and it could be emphasized in some more phrases. then. if (er) if one of laws of logic especially the law of identity is violated we come to the language game (er) for instance I was always almost always at home but I was not always at home at home or so I said nothing or nothing here is one more interesting example is presented here but I will read it (er) wait a second I'm sorry yeah you would not bring the sound but you are not content to be not content or they kept producing things that we didn't need that we needed so you see this language game sometimes is based on the repetition of the same words phrase or some grammar (em) structure which then has some shift in its meaning and we have to understand it and to dig deeper (er) and last again but not least example is double negation we should pay extra attention to it as with the help of double negation the author combines some opposite categories again what I was not unrealistic anymore not unthinking just reckless and negations of these kind actualised semantics of uncertainty ambiguity double meaningness which are also seen on the level of ideas. so coming to some conclusions we can track that alogisms is displayed in all layers of this short story and actually on the whole (er) in the whole kind of style of (character name) suffering for it but is here is presented on the one short story but we could analyze a whole variety of his other literary works and alogisms serve sometimes as the link connection which is often absent in the short story contrasting ideas combination of opposites and denial of rational thinking are then expressed in these categorical images and then find some realization in the language including double legations oxymorons and language game alogism is seen as a stylistic mean and it is often used to express some sarcasm (er) humour as well as grotesque or it is used to show some controversial ideas processes or paradoxes (er) it is quite ok to believe that here in the short story the author actually tries to (mm) again he has to emphasize this controversy the controversial processes probably and in our case it's possible to think that alogism is at the same time the way of author's thinking or which is done reflects on the way of (er) (mm) character speech and at the same time it's kind of a linguistic representation of these cognitive processes so thatâ€™s if you're interested you can take a look at reference list and which some in  some works which were used and I'm happy to answer questions   maybe we will first ask other people to ask questions not us do you have any questions cause maybe you    you mentioned that (er) no one short story talks about relationships between men and women would you say that alogism is an aspect of them   relationships you mean in real life   no In  how this alogism relate to the explanation of relationships between the men and women   oh well probably I haven't stated this in particular this connection with relationships (er) but maybe because they there seeing some controversy between characters like for example there was a pot when when the child was born and there was a paragraph consisted of almost all sentences beginning with I laughed or I hated and you laughed and you hated and there was really seen some contradiction between what the main character which is I loves and hates and which what thinks his wife should what in the short story it was you loves and hates so yeah I would probably think about this thing   just to clarify when you say that the not the story consists of similar sentences what do you mean by similar  I mean that they're not of course all similar but (er) quite often we see parallelism syntactic parallelism as we I suppose yes they almost all begin with the subject then verb and object and so on   (mhm) thank you (em) if I got you correctly you said that the rate the things in categories   probably which is   kind of I mean how how much is it close to what you're supposed   to to alogism   is can it be one of the statements that when you say something is similar to this   yes   ok thank you cause it seems to me to contradict the thesis about the rate to be immersed in the sensual world   (mm)   is thinking in categories that's abstract   it's abstract yes   and that's logic   yes  so and this   that's again the second In other early alogism   but that's not probably in the story that's your evaluation of the story   that's true  and then you have this contradiction of the narrator or can you explain it anyway so is it is the text sential or rational   (em)...that's difficult (er) I would say it is more sensual than rational but still it deals with some really big notions again like love like hatred there are some sentences like I was enabled to I didn't know how so all of these kind of (er) categories of being able to be unable so loving hating (er) I didn't know but they concerns mostly some census  so this is again why maybe this is kind of a contradiction  ok and just probably last question from me I was trying to be with the examples that you showed and I kind of didn't have the time   full in some I agree and some disagree or particularly can I have a look again at your example of  double negation sure I mean why do you find this illogical    which linguistics of wh= sorry what (er) yes double negations  yeah  (er) because sorry (er) in logic actually there is ..some operation which is negation and it could be (er) used (er) here's a slightly negative applied to negative storms yes but (er) here actually it's (mm) in logic it could be you know some contrasted so not not not a is a it is certain in logic you know   so I was not unrealistic  so I was rather really realistic not about logic it's about the degree which goes beyond long    so I was kinda be rather rather realistic yes  so not ideological but but a logical   it is kind of it goes against the it it doesn't go against the logic it follows the same logical rules but it is not often seen in language and it is   rather often an English actually   well yes   typical of English way of expression just need you to consider I'm done   right so I wanted to ask why do you think all of this is what happened in the story it's not to just the paragraphs of the story to see how striking than usual it is how striking then usual of the language is and so you choose to take a look at all of that through this through the prism of this notion of alogism yeah but speaking about the big picture yeah how why is the story written like this what does the author achieve by manipulating the language well and according to you the logic in this extraordinary way   to my mind again yes because it's kind of personal experience of reading the story yes  but it was a personal reading of a scholar  I believe that this this kind of the aim of the author was to put a question to .to really question relationships question marriage question love because it actually ends in a as it ends a with a question and (mm) I think just yes that actually it to question everything to show how how various everything could be and how how quickly it ends Because the kind of the topic the headline is (er) and here we aren't so quickly so probably to show some (mm) really quick pace of life and some frag= that the world is fragile Everything is fragile   ok and another one. so this story is written .well it's a character narration right   yes so the first person narration so do you think that the narrator believes that this way of expression is a natural way of expression or does the narrator deliberately produce this speech which is so bizarre from the point of view of our common language?  (er) I think (er).. he does he doesn't do it deliberately he doesn't have this aim of (mm) I don't know proving something or making some (er) emphasis to to change something that is probably what he thinks because yes as I have already mentioned there's not much connection between some connection between sentences so he could move from (er) making a toast in the morning to (er) driving a car and mentioning some details about that so probably are just to kind of (er) just his thoughts coming to mind   if the narrator is not doing it deliberately then it has to tell us as readers something about the narrator right so how would how would it characterize the narrator such speech what are we supposed to infer from   if he unconsciously uses that kind of very idiosyncratic language   yes probably he's a man which which is lost no he's man that it's different that he's a man because   he's married with children that explains it   no no they're they're different they're different man married with children probably he's very lost man and he tries to find again some answers he analyzes his life his past experience of it I think the word lost would would say it most so  do you know who he is   who the narrator no we have only I as the narrator   and we cannot guess  we cannot yet he doesn't have any name we can guess that he is a he because there was a part in which you which is his wife has a child so we kind of can know that a man   well things happen  well this was in 2010 probably then people couldn't have child from man  thank you/
