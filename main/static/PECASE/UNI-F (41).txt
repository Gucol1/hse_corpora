 good afternoon name and I'm historian from Perm's Higher School Economics (er) want apologize advance those who may have already heard this presentation Russian but let be as you can see talk will focus the first translations John Tolkien into Russian and the historical cultural and social conditions their appearance (eh) will get know Tolkien's first translators sorry little bit (er) then we'll turn the history the dissemination his text the west then we'll move to the Soviet translations and finally we'll try understand their motives the translators and the meaning Tolkien's books for them ... is interesting that practically the same time within the same decade different completely unrelated people became interested the work an author who was little known the USSR the time and are talking about the translation . self published translation Alexander Rubber and finally the book and took out the study the life world Tolkien translation into Russian and part the study was find out how John Tolkien's image was shaped the Russian environment and what were the motives for translating these texts (er) also had determine how the social cultural situation the country influenced this decision my work based the recollections the translators themselves memoirs their close friends and relatives well interviews including own ... is often believed that John Tolkien's name was completely unknown Soviet society and refute this opinion let first look the distribution Tolkien's text the west in the 70s and also the 60s the United States and Western Europe experienced phenomenon that manifested itself sharp rise the popularity Tolkien's books and the emergence numerous forms reflection the work the professor this includes the translation his works into European languages John Tolkien's persona the West became massively famous during these years and soon touched the territory socialist countries active efforts began translate Tolkien into the languages the Soviet bloc and the first translation the Hobbit was printed Slovak then you can see the slide the book was translated into Serbian Russian Estonian and Czech so members the Russian intelligentsia had plenty opportunities come across the author's name and reference books to hear about the appearance translation these books ... under such circumstances three translators independent one another decided translate the same author (er) they lived three different cities they did not know each other and their social circles were not connected and did not intersect with each other in addition all three also belong different schools translation can classified belonging the Leningrad school translation (er) the 50s she studied under prominent representatives the school never attended translation courses and studied the art translation independently it can assumed that his translation belonging formalism in broader sense literallism it difficult determine whether belonged one school another it known that studied (er) under and with whose approach disagreed but we analyze style can find similarities with the principle realistic translation (er) according which was very widespread those years ... (er) unexpectedly each these translators decided take the translation John Tolkien's books (er) the non random nature this coincidence can explained drawing parallels between the authors and demonstrating their similarities between them and the most obvious similarity their philosophical education ... another peculiarity their interest foreign literature (er) all three authors translate mostly from English and one way another interect with the West the Hobbit came from foreign friends the writer addition the translator may have heard John Token's name from (er) literary friends come across independently domestic publications was interested science fiction and encyclopedias (er) and could also have met John Tolkien after seeing his name one the reference books in addition his wife went business trips abroad ... from there she brought not only books but also information about popular English English writers social circles consisted translators and literary figures who were certainly aware popular books abroad nor can deny the possibility that was acquainted with excerpt The Hobbit published Magazine England Англия Russian in each case (er) the initiative translate belonged the author and was not the order the editors. began working translation the Hobbit soon after reading .. was clear that children would find interesting and useful so she took a couple the translated chapters herself the editor who approved the publication ... eager introduce the book his children and decides undertake the translation he undertook the translation solely distribute among his loved ones the text was not intended for the general public initially and translated the book for themselves but after finishing the work they decided get published the translators negotiated long and persistently until they finally agreed publish the book ... can assume that each translator one way another sees their text political manifesto which reflection their worlds all them had sad experience with Soviet regime and this experience subsequently superimposed itself the meaning Tolkien's book and change their perception the text translators ... many love ones and friends suffered from the actions the Soviet government her father her teacher translators close family friends and her husband reflection the life world and her disagreement with the Soviet reality which forced exist evident her attitude towards the text rather than the text itself and the main thing The Hobbit for her was the idea the value the so-called small person ... teachers who suffered under the Soviet regime played major role shaping personality this his academic adviser his favorite teacher and also close friend his he was also not active opponent the Soviet system although did not use the Soviet policy very positively argues that The Lord the Rings about the struggle between right and wrong while the unreliable nature the text ... the environment which lived and grew strongly influenced his perception The Lord the Rings since childhood grew among antisoviets and later became part the social circle opponents the government and having read The Lord the Rings and his friend perceived the book militantly through the prison the Soviet system thought put his view into the translation make the book proclamation rebellion against the brutal regime 
 least think you can moving closer the conclusions 
 (er )okay, (er) I`m ready finish. we can see some similarity between the translators. which allows to suggest. that they largely perceived their reality around them the same way and this largely depends their presence political connotation the text and (er) the text translation full allusion because that instead conclusions I will say that John Tolkien turned out be outlet for the Soviet intelligentsia and they saw his books allusion the contemporary reality and skillfully transfer Soviet reality through these translations okay yeah think I'm ready finish and answer questions 
 Thank you ... (erm) any questions colleagues listeners ... right understanding your speech as that translators were using Tolkien's work more like. opportunity for metaphor of the political regime more than for example they desired escape that kind social reality moving and move away from that into the fantasy world 
 can say that tries .. (er) with the help the Hobbit escape from the Soviet reality but the case with and can see that (er) there lot evidence the text that they try proclaim something 
 they have different strategies yeah this 
 Yes 
 does also depend the material that they were translating Hobbit fore fairy tale 
 yes think and loved children books she was very kind and pretty nature 
 that`s genre that`s aspect genre well anything else any other questions ... okay  thank you very much that was very us you were talking
