 (er) nice meet (er) all name (er)and presented (er) the problems the protection trade secrets the Russian Federation (er) every year the capacity development the market guds =goods and services the economic community increases which lead which leads increased competition the market and these phenomenon (er) leads (er) that (er) every (er) manufacture whether is entrepreneur huge enterprise thinks about how protect information (er) secret and how regulate this mechanism therefore trade secrets (er) are not disclosed but (erm) the protection trade secrets carries problems (uh) the problems the (uh) the protection trade secrets (er) are that the protection trade secrets complex legal institution which enshrined the civil code the Russian Federation and the federal law (er) the trade secrets the Russian Federation (er) but (er) these legal (er) documents not facilitate (er) the understanding trade secrets and its application modern legal reality (er) and (er) (er) this (er) highlighted (er) (er) the law enforcement practice courts and the legal doctrine its protection special economic zones and (er).. the main problem the protection trade secrets Russia fede= in Russia the problem differentiation trade secrets from know-how and (er) the problem protection trade secrets special economic zones (er) the first problem (er) problem differentiation trade secrets from know-how (er) the law enforcement practice courts shows that (er) trade secrets are equated know-how which leads conflict (er) law and (er) based doctrinal developments primarily the Roman German (er) legal family and well the position (er) professor. believe that trade secret more capacious and voluminous concept which includes the secret production know-how well other types commercial information (er) the Russian legislator (mhm) Identifies (er) the com= (mhm) the context (er) and the concept (er) (er) the trade secrets (er) (er) chapter (er) seventy five the Civil code Russian Federation and (er) the medium term (er).. can expect significant changes the formation the entire conceptual apparatus private law (er) should noted that know-how may not fully observed (er) the trade (er) secrets regime (er) for example mister (name the author) believes that know-how the object transfer and relates transactions and business secret legal entering retains for its own use (er) for example this may (er) relate the results market research may subject transaction (er) also (mhm) this regard believes that (er) trade secrets and the object its protection not any information protected and the discretion the business entity inspect which (er) the confidentiality regime established (er) seems that add such information should your primary related the business activity the person and (er) here we're talking about the potential can commercial value such information (erm) its connection with business activities (er) otherwise (er) there may confusion (er) trade secrets with personal data (er) with personal secrets and on (er) and today seems us more successful legislative interpretation the concept trade secrets not through the what information (er) but through the category (er) mode access information and mode confidentiality information (er). and (er). the position the legislator have not made fully full clarity the problem the ratio trade secrets and know-how remains quite controversial and course relevant (er) can seen is quite difficult for the judicial authorities determine the diff= (er) the difference the concept trade secrets and (er) secret production know-how clearly discuing= distinguish when the secret production know how only kind information constituting trade secrets and when this concept (er) actually coincides with the concept trade secrets (er) given the current state legislation using several concerts once (er) such production secret (er) know-how and information (er) constituting the trade secret this seems almost inevitable (er) and the legislative proceeded from the fact that all these terms are synonymous ..(er) the second problem (er) (er) protection trade secrets problem (mhm) and (er) specific economic zones is relevant because (er) ...many and many economic activities appeared ...(er) every year and the creation special economic (er) zones the Russian Federation will regulated the law (er) is the federal (er) law special economic zones the Russian Federation and provides for the possibility creating two types such zones industrial production and technical implementation (er) and the same (er) the same time the question arises what stage should access information restricting restricted (er) minimizing the risk unfair competition and ensuring the growth competitive (er) advantages during the commercialization innovation these economic zones (er) therefore where take into account the moment when (er) there product potential commercial value (er) believing that from (mhm) that time free access information closed confidential scientific (er) technical economic and other information has real potential value (er) (er) according the law the Russian Federation trade secret (er) can classified information constituting trade secret (er) however the information created acquired the main stages (er) technical and implementation activities being its nature trade secret and (er) and can have different commercial value depending the degree readiness the product for implementation (erm) innovated (er) innovative projects identified the subjects (er) relationships and research organizations technology development organization venture capitalist and object relations new developments and items relationship commercial interests (er) seems that (er) the organization (er) relations the issue over commercial interests (er) and determines (er) the need for specialization such activities (er) which can called the administration the trade secret regime the purpo= the purpose these specializa= speci= specialization personification (erm) the responsibility for the development and application methods complian= (um) compliance with the (mhm) with the trade secret regime (er). thus the protection trade secret has its problems (er) particular the problem differentiation from know-how and the problem regulation trade secrets (er) special economic zones but for each problem there solution (er) for the first.. (er) problem.. (erm) can offer that the distinction between trade secrets and know-how important since the second compence (er) concept higher specialized then the first and for these (er) legislator should distinguish these concepts the civil code (er) since acts law enforcement practice and subsequently leads the less satisfaction claims which make impossible protect (er) the commercial secret (er) the plaintiff he not the offer these product (er) and for the second problem (mhm) can proposed deduce the criteria for evaluating information that will later in the mode trade secrets and avoid unjustified attribution information trade secrets (er) underestimation its commercial significance errors the choice methods and periods protection the allocation funds for protection (er) and tool needed assess the commercial attractivness the information (mhm) that's all wanted say ... any questions
oh yes (er) what you thin think what are the historical reasons for such situation
(er) this (er) this connected (er) with the history Russia such the period (er) uses (er) USSR (er) because (er) (er) the intellectual property law (er) and created (er) (er) two thousands (er) whereas (er) (er) the USSA (er) USR (er) (er) can see (er) the law which (er) (er) which connected with (er) privatization (er) not (er) (er) not belongs every (er) entrepreneur every manufacture (er) this belongs the (mhm) goverment
thank you
can get questionthank you for the presentation and interested trade secrets theme (er) well I've I've heard about course the problem differe= (er) diff= differentiation between trade secrets and know-how that was the first time I've heard about the problem about the specific economic zones could you please clarify once again what's the main problem because far know specific economic zones are usually connected with the well different versions taxes mean tax free regime for entities who work this specific economic zones and on what what's the main problem here that entity who work these zones enter such legal regime information what
(er) think is connected with innovation process all (er) because (er) all processes
has different stages and (er) when created (er) information (erm) many people (er) work with this information and (er) (er) the competitors (er) may (er) may get this information and (er) they (er) they can produce (er) whitely (er) (er) widely when (er) the first (er) innovator (mhm) produce these product and (er) on (er) this (er) this leads the problem the protection the information (er) about innovation process all and (er) the stages this process
(mhm) well can you continue (erm) we've got some time yeah well that's (er) that's right that there great difference between (er) well for example patent activity that helps you protect your innovation yes and effectively well protect your patent right you see that (er) competitor (er) violates them yeah well think that there such such problem between the (er) the the different regimes protection your innovations mean trade secret regime patent activity (er) exists the whole territory Russia in the world can say well there really problem specific economic zones that's question well you know what's the question (er) my question was about that you can protect your innovation different types legal regimes right you can have patent
yeah
that will publicly (er) well published that will published and everybody will know what's the thing what's your main (er) innovation that you give out yes however you will have some patent protection that will long and after that will to the public domain well what about trade secret (er) you've got such possibility however somebody will copy all your innovation process you can net you cannot protect yourself yes from that violation using only trade secret regime you that's the main problem well that's the main minus trade secret regime right now there problem about in this specific economic zone
(um) I can explain (uh) this the example (er) the government (er) production for example (er) when (er) when innovators creates new (er) type (er) (mhm) nuclear weapons such (er) (er) they (er) cannot (er) patent these (er) information because (er) (er) is connected with the government and (er) (er) and it's may protect the trades the regime trade secret (mhm) because (er) they can (er) innovated with the different (er) partners such (er) China (er) Japan and others (er) and this leads (er) and this leads the need the regime trade secrets specific economic zones
(mhm) thank you
thank you
