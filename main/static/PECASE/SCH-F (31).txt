 well thank you very much well really urgent topic think (uhu) now you've got question well you are welcome 
 very good presentation and (em) yeah you done great job and it's very was very beautiful theme that you picked an actual appearance (em) one thing I'm kind have two questions one them could you just clarify that slide where you had circle showing different emotions and their personages could you clarify what you meant companies using indifference 
 (em) just second 
 yeah 
 you mean indifference indifference an emotion people who has suffered from violence (em) it's (em) I think this emotion characteristic people who wants change the situation but they don't know how they can change something advertisers make (em) ... they try demonstrate demonstrate that indifference not that way that people want (em) thet people should choose they want (em) change the situation with domestic abuse Russia and think other countries are not good not good 
 (uhu) 
 and then (em) thank you yeah that's understand better now and other question what you think could done change these advertisements create more action since you said only twenty-five percent viewer are estimated take action after seeing that advertisements 
 sorry can you repeat your question actually did not understand 
 yeah how you think could change these advertisements that more people take action 
 (uhu) 
 (em) think can suppose that maybe advertisers should use more (em) more non-verbal components that will present that domestic abuse not good should changed other people for example maybe advertisers should use more (em) shock images cases violence appearance characters and maybe (em) big slogans that will it's not non-verbal component it's verbal component it's (em) actually important 
 well shocking images yes can attract more attention well the public 
 yes 
 see thank you thank you you've got one more question (uhu) (uhu) 
 thank you for your presentation since you are more than some our participants little bit more critics (em) and first all I'd like comment your suggestion use more violence images if you had made real social advertisements you should learn that this doesn't work using more violent images least for animals for treating animals doesn't work doesn't make people be (em) more become kinder towards animals and believe same thing might happen with humans probably this not the best way and it's indeed open question what would the best component create optimal the most efficient advertsement the second point would like know how the emotions were evaluated that's second question and (em) one comment that actually indifference not emotion you take classicals there on what emotions (em) you can find different kind classifications according Paul Ekman who (em) british (em) psychologist (em) specializing emotions and doesn't have indifference there has six basic emotions other (em) classifications (em) for example Robert Plutchik but I've never seen classification have indifference (em) would advise you be more the terminology you use and would like know how these emotions were evaluated this case and actually maybe have missed this where all other figures your diagrams come from how was they obtained 
 thank you for your questions (em) first all understand (em) you would like know opinion about best decisions (em) 
 would like know how these emotions were evaluated how we know that this happiness the different approaches evaluate emotions people automatic laboratory maze manual searching and looking rating different scales would like know how these emotions were evaluated your study and were all other figures come from for example this number this percentage advertisements use this type so would like know what database was used this study 
 (em) 
 about emotions how were emotions evaluated measured yeah 
 yeah if you take several advertisements how you know that this woman displaying fear indifference happiness don't know what 
 (em) have (em) just second try (em) 
 well any calculations maybe scales which scales did you use your study scales yeah 
 number advertisements that researched (em) okay understand (em) our analysis was based twenty posters and every poster every advertisement there were some emotions characters and agree that indifference maybe not emotion that ... condition victim violence 
 would recommend for the future research ongoing research just try specify more rigorous way what's you're doing (em) because have valid data have valid results you would definitely need increase the number posters that you're going (em) examine for other posters that you're going do your future studies please as much size possible with the structure that you apply that's general recommendation 
 thank you thank you very much 
 thank you very much well anything else who would like clarify well thank you
