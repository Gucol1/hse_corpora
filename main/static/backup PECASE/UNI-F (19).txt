 then we give the floor to (name of speaker) if we go from pronouncing surname correctly and we'll move on to linguistic means of reconstruction in oral tradition in Tolkien   thank you once again good afternoon dear colleagues I'm glad to see you here and today I would like to present my research (er) Linguistic means of construction of oral tradition in Tolkien's fairy tales  so in this light you can see some of my presentation First of all I will talk about an epic poem Beowulf as a part of Tolkien's academic research (er) and give you some basic information about the epic poem itself It is very important to focus on according to my research (er) then I will turn to Talkien’s fairy tale (er) which is called Savage Spell and show you the main expressive and descriptive means in the text according to oral tradition and after that I will make a conclusion so let's start as you know (er) John Ronald a (name of writer) Tolkien was not only a great writer a father of high fantasy but also a talented academic In the nineteen twenties (er) Tolkien under two interest lation of the epic poem  from old English to modern English He finished the translation in 1926 but actually didn't publish it It was finally edited by his son Christopher Tolkien and published only in twenty fourteen In fact (er) Beowulf is one of the greatest examples of Anglo-Saxon literature this story was passed on orally from generation to generation and then was written down by an anonymous writer in the 8th century. today as we know it's manuscript is housed in the British Library in London (er) for a long time such as of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf where based on the historical context however. Tolkien always draw attention to the previous neglect= previously neglected literary qualities of the poem and argued that it should be studied as a work of art not just (er) simple historical document and indeed nowadays there is an active growth of scientific interest in the side of the  through its folklore elements that can help other researchers to identify the formation process of the survived poem version as I have as I have already sorry mentioned at first the epic point was passed on orally from generation to generation and (er) as we can guess the folklore elements that can be find in the text of the epic poem are also based in oral tradition but what is it what is the oral tradition itself (er) well oral tradition is a form of human communication wherein .some information is received preserved and transmitted orally from genere= from one generation to another so if you see the logic here there is a logic here the transmission is through speech or song and may also include (er) folk tales ballads chants or prose .and others things (er).. so having examined this surviving version of the poem Beowulf in the 1940s Tolkien like Anglo Saxon Scope or a storyteller (er) created (name of the tale) (name of the tale) is a fairy tale or (er) we can also call it like pre saga or  according to the Irish tradition or just a fantasy quick piece on Beowulf biographical background that (er) could have been passed on orally from one person to another Long before the epic poem appeared itself (er). in order to reconstruct a specifically northern version of these folktale (er) the versions of the scope could have heard and used in his epic composition Tolkien put the text of fairy tale first into old English and then translated it into modern English the title (name of the tale) also itself comes from the epic poem Beowulf and (er) Tolkien actually translated it as a wondrous tale It is You know is signifisent terms of the wonder tale is the particular folktale genre that gave birth to the literary (er) fairy tale that we all recognize today .Tolkien believed that his reconstructed folktale provided a good solution to many strange difficult and  elements in the epic poem (em) as we will see the text of the fairytale (name of the tale) is realized with the help of a complex of specific linguistic means (er) started as a part of the langua centric approach as a part of the lingua centric approach I have analyzed the texts of (name of the tale) using the  the Irina Arnold’s concept classifying the main categories of linguistic means of the fairy tale into two groups (er) there are so expressive and descriptive means .so (er) the first group descriptive means are represented by a variety of expressive means or syntactic constructions that you can see in the slide (er) that they enhanced the expressiveness of speech we  speak about the oral tradition itself and they are also important components of the compositional organization or the fairy tale (er) so and as you see speech formulas (er) play the most important (er) role in the text of the fairytale and it is very interesting to see that speech formulas usually begin (er) with once upon a time or one day in time .. the second group is represented by some speaking name that we can find in the text of the fairy tale (er) they .(mm) combine with other stylistic devices such as comparison hyperbola and irony items and create (er) vivid and memorable images of characters of the fairy tale so (mm) as you can see for example the main (er) character of the fairytale is (er) Beowulf so there are some kind of variation in the in writing if we (er) read (er) the fairytale (er) if we read fairy tale but while you will get the logic so Beowulf is the mix role for bear and the wolf and we can make it as a bear finally and for example ..(er) with the help of hyperbola we see that Beowulf is very strength and he is really associated with a strong bear for example his strength was that of thirty so having examined the main expressive and descriptive means and their function in the text of Tolkien's fairy tail (name of the tale) who through the principles of oral tradition I can really say that these linguistic features play an important role in author's reconstruction of oral tradition in the form of a prosaic text and the study gives us the opportunity to better understand the writer's (er) intent and provides the basis for further translation of talking fairytale into the Russian language (er). thank you so much for your attention and if you have questions you are welcome to ask..  of talking fairytale into the Russian language thank you so much for your attention and if you have questions you are welcome to .  thank you very much ..any questions  I understand (er) how the (name of the tale) how it relates to Beowulf  you said    ok I will never mind so I will explain it to you In fact (name of the tale) is (er).so so to say prequel to the epic poem Beowulf because Tolkien himself added some new episodes for example (er) how Beowulf grew up what were his first feast and first for example swimming competition so (er) these episodes (er) can’t be found in the epic poem so that's why it is some kind to say a prequel or pre saga  so it just does not cover the gap that have that takes place between the two parts of beowulf   oh well so to say it covers both parts of the epic poem but.(er) while if you read the text you will really see that it is a fairytale because (er) Tolkien (er) added some new (er) characters that (er) go with Beowulf to the to the to another so= country to help so the king . and so they they help to kill Grandal to help to survive   so so so not no= not exactly prequel but rather an extended version of the original  and and the cover   yeah so yeah the version that yeah that yeah that could be passed orally along before the .epic poem itself appeared so ..just an attempt to do that  .. when ypu mention the author's intent in the conclusions what is it   oh well (em) at first time I was very interested (er) why Tolkien decided to write some kind of fairy tale (er) that can that that is that was connected with (er) Beowulf itself and I found some sources that (er) showed me (er) difference so different purposes of (er) this writer so that he was really he he really (er) liked Beowulf(er) He (er) so Beowulf influenced Tolkien very much and so and so to say I want to see the maybe a part of the ideal style of the writer so comes like   so h= he= here you  biographical writer's intention right so not for example internal right not the  not the not the the fairy tales intention as a text   that's his yeah so II was interested in Tolkien's notes letters and what he wanted to reference reconstruct or discover according the studies of Beowulf the epic poem   I was trying to connect the title of your research with which you were speaking about I was thinking about why for example hyperbole is a means of reconstructing oral tradition  so (er) it is only a part of my research work it it is yeah so and it is just the beginning of it because I will have a really very detailed research and in the future(er) but anyway so as (er) Tolkien (er) wanted to show how oral tradition worked (er) so a long ago I thought that in the text we could have found some items that can be (er) really useful in order to express oral tradition so yeah You see it as a text but if we imagine that it is it wasn't a text at all so it is like you know a poem or (er) just oral information that you have and you want to pass on from one person to another  I fully agree with that what I mean is (er) well particularly by for example hyperbole is a feature of an oral tradition one that makes it so oralistic  my question  .  no I just also was wondering is there a source that you used to identify some of these means right as characteristic of oral tradition (em) is it based on some research Is it based on your analysis based on comparison of of of this fairy tale you  for how do you  this list of features  so it actually (mm) based on Tolkient’s (er) notesso and while I have (er) to Ddt of all we have a fairytale and secondly we have a lot of folklore element folklore element that we can find in the text so and moreover it can be based somehow in oral tradition so ther= there is very yeah so there is a very complicated question to answer but well   right and I mean things on your slides like speaking of comparisons so what is your motivation what you are claiming somehow representative  tradition    so will you agree that not every descriptive means or every expressive means exemplifies orality   oh yes I would agree but yeah so (er) oral tradition is like a basis for my research and for Tolkien  but yes of course it is yeah so it is a real fairy tale so and it has as I have already said a lot of hyperbolas irony   alright (mm) are there any instances when well where the teller of this fairy tale (mm) addresses the audience Because if if you talk about  about somebody who pretends to be talking to a living person   figure of a bard yeah   so as I know oral tradition usually is based on alliteration of some kind of things but in these texts we don't have alliteration at all so and we all if we speak about (mm) oral tradition and fairy tale the combination of them we will see only (mm) repetitions for example (er) so three months by month so some kind of tautological repetition that we can call in Russian and speech formula that really organized the text so one day once upon a time in time and so on   alright thank you
