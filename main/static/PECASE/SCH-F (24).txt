so the second task was analyze Orthodox civilization position this theory and also find some opinion the national experts the Russian position the modern world and make conclusion. let start with the biography Phillips Samuel Phillips Huntington. was American politicial science and writer. and wrote the thesis the clash civilizations. and later expanded into his book the clash civilization syndrome making world older order. he studied Garvard and after earning his doctorates began teaching. there specialized American politics the beginning his career and also was political commentator national debates US foreign policy.. let's talk about theory. the clash civilization thesis that people culture and religious and identities will the primary source context the post Cald War. future.. war will future wars will fought not between countries but between cultures. it's not between two countries it's between some blocks countries. and.. also think that local conflicts..(er) will clash some crash some civilization. and think that there no doubt that Western civilization not the main one but all existing civilizations form the world.. this the map that consists. identifies eight main (eh) civilizations. first all it's the Western civilization also is Latin American Orthodox Islamic African Sinic Hindu Budduist Japanese and on. but also has two special terms. is lone countries and its cleft countries let's talk about Russian positions Ortho his theory. (eh) his opinion Russia center Orthodox civilization but addition considers Russia be cleft country. because Russia can't cannot decide between.. Western and Eastern values. his opinion Russia's closest ally India and then the west and the main enemies are China Japan and Islamic countries.. and addition his opinion Russia has been following the path modernization through reforms and revolution all its history but. this has caused great contradictions society think can say that the last revolution Russian history was the nineteenth year the last. century. let's speak about modern situation and modern position Russian positions Russia's position so. now think Russia. particularly doesn't follow Eastern Western values but it's trying combine and create its own values. we can see we can all see now and moreover nowadays all know that Russia and China main partnership relations unlike the west which considers Russia and China its main enemies it is. one the minuses theory Huntington's theory the modern world. it goes without saying that Russia has change the past three years. changed lot for example industry has reached the seventh place the world.. also our students and pupils winning international Olympiads and Russian athletes set new records and some countries the world think that Russia important politici political situation the world.. they visit Russia and have some. positive partnership with our country taking into account everything mentioned above can make conclusion. that contemporary situation Russia occupies more. advantages position the world than thirty years ago therefore Huntington's theory was relevant thirty years ago but now actually works some positions like. works the cases future where will. shifting because culture not because countries and.. that.. there some process shifting the center the world from west the other countries.. that's all that want tell you about my. work...
okay thank you I guess you can stop sharing your screen now. and invite everybody come with the follow questions.. then probably can start you don't mind well well actually while was listening. your talk. the first question was how come that you being just high school student. school girl got interested this topic.
we talk about this topic our history lessons last year when we.. talk about some Russian some wars some Russian wars with Turkey. was about also also was about First World War and think what think why there were lot wars between Russia and other countries and talk about this theory because help to understand why Russia have lot wars with countries that our allies sometimes but they are our animal our enemies other time.
I see okay thank you and next question second question. you mentioned that well.. this researcher Samuel Huntington his idea was that Russia cannot decide between Western and Eastern values do you agree if you what the evidence for that give some evidence you don't agree again would you please explain.
it's really hard question because our history our country our history always can't understand what need do. what where need go because have big the big territory our country have Asian part have Euro part. Euro part want go the European way but West way but other Asian country want go the Eastern way but think now we. have our own values our own way because. need talk about modern situation the world when West countries don't understand Russia they sometimes hate Russia and Russian political Russians politics because they don't want have strong Russia strong country but and but and not all people the Asian country the Eastern countries understand Russia and think the best way go have some. go our history. develop our country need have our own values and because not other civilizations can understand us. because our own way.
