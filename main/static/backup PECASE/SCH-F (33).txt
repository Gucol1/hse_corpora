 the next speaker is  uhu well consumer motives in advertising campaigns of beauty brands in Russia and USA well comparison we'll see  you are welcome 
 hello everybody my name is  and I’m a second year student of Perm National Research Polytechnic University so today I’m presenting my research on consumer motives in advertising campaigns . sorry . of beauty brands in Russia and USA (em) the main objective of my research to study consumer motives in beauty advertising and discover tendencies in motive usage that characterize Russsian and American beauty markets so the study is conducted on sixty samples  of commercials on the slide you can see some of the criteria that were used and also you can see some of the goals that were set during this research . so first let’s talk about what consumer motivation or motive is it is a term that is often used in marketing and advertising and it describes an internal state that drives people to identify and buy products or services that fulfil their conscious and unconscious needs or desires . so there are three types usually (em) rational emotional and ethical . moving on here the results of my research on Russian market (em) twenty two motives were identified on Russian market mostly emotional motives are used as you can see they make up seventy three percent while rational motives make up twenty seven in the study materials three rational motives were identified the motives of versatility efficiency of the product and additional benefits so versatility motive is usually reflected in verbal elements stating that the product is suitable for different needs skin types etcetera or has multiple uses for example in the advertising for Garnier products it’s reflected in the name of the product itself (em) multiple efficiency is expressed through statistical data or expert confirmation and additional benefit is used by marketers who want to declare the advantage of a product over the competitors products and talk about additional function in two commercials for foundations we see that they use products skincare proprieties as such function . so emotional motives are quite diverse but obviously motive of beauty stands out so we can see this motive reflected on camera focusing on faces of commercially attractive models that use the product and pose there and talk about its properties so we have also noticed that it is often closely related replaced by motive of health specifically of skin . so the motive of novelty is used by three brands and it is expressed in verbal repeated use of the word new so now speaking about the US cosmetic market we are seing the images of new motive ethical motive (em) it was encountered twice and accounted for eleven percent and otherwise the distribution is quite similar to he Russian market so the ethical motive is found in the advertising of two brands Covergirl and NYX we have defined it identified as ethical production it is reflected in such elements of the commercials as rabbit which in the case of a product is not tested on animals different signs that indicate formula without animal products so it is also closely related to the motive of caring of the environment . among rational motives we can see versatility and efficiency the same as on the Russian market and a new rational motive of quality two brands use it in the advert it can be it can find verbal expression like in slogan of a product for Clinique it’s no parabens just healthy skin or you can see sign of skin cancer foundation  so moving on to emotional motives it is also the beauty motive is the most is used the most frequently . the motive of imitation it’s the use of celebrity in commercials or influencers social media influencers theyir names are also reminded to the viewer  verbally like through the text on the screen in this case Mycosmetics uses the k-pop singer to be the face of their product the motive of self-expression is used in two adverts it is usually present in commercials for makeup products not so much skincare obviously and we encountered it in revlon video they use of model of unconventional appearance who tries on a variety of colors and along with different styles and clothes so . to sum-up we can draw several conclusions  rational and emotional motives used in Russian and American beauty advertisments are overall similar however there are slight differences emotional motives prevail in both markets beuty motive prevails in both markets however in Russian market we can see that the motive of novelty is used while in American it’s self-expression and imitation and a distinctive feature or US beauty market is the usage of an ethical motive of ethical production so that’s it thank you for your attention I will be happy to answer your questions 
 well thank you very much  well great presentation you can stop okay well questions well you are welcome 
 thank you very much I have just one question I would like to know your opinion on this issue that may potentially affect not your study but any kind of study any studies of this kind how could you manage the problem that explicitly expressed feelings about one's motivation may not reveal true purchase motives because there are certain studies I would say  studies showing that for example when people buy ecofriendly cars or dishwashers they state that they thinking actually about the ecology about nature but the true motivation might be different the true motivation might be career (em) achievements social links and others like being visible in the society the things that people may not even aware themselves when making these decisions     
 thank you very much for question well I wasn’t analyzing the reasons why people buy some product because analyzing (em) the motives that advertisers put into the messages they sent so yeah that’s why I don’t know it’s really relevant why people buy some product 
 okay now it’s clear that it’s other side thank you 
 thank you 
 okay well  please 
 very nice presentation by the way my question is about the target audiences for these products so (em) you compare beauty products between (em) how those advertisements are perceived by Russian and the US audiences so typically the woman are the target audiences of these advertisements they are trying to influence on women making purchases so how do you think the things you considered such as versatility or efficiency of a product do you think that the perception and the things that are measured are different between Russian and American man as opposed to woman  
 thank you for your question well I think actually beauty industry in Russia also uses no advertizes products to men as well men in Russia also use cosmetics and I have found examples of the advertisements that use men models so I wouldn’t say I mean yeah obviously I don’t . know if it’s political question (em) . yeah obviously I feel like an American man uses beauty products more often and beauty brands consider man more often wen they create advertisements 
 well  it was interesting for me to see that self expression you called yes 
 yeah 
 well for russian advertising it wasn’t typical yeah  
 yeah it was less typical  
 have you tried to analyze the reasons for why because some of for me self-expression seems to be one of the main things well we buy different products well beauty products we would like to express well ourselves 
 well I didn’t it’s not a part of my research obviously but like my opinion on this is (em) I feel like in Russia maybe makeup is marketed mostly to women who use makeup like nude makeup they go to work in general and I feel like maybe in America people use makeup to express themselves more often I don’t know (em) I do think it’s going to change and I do think more advertisers will consider this motive in the adverts 
 well I think it’s serious motive for many people okay tank you
