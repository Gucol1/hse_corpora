invite our next two speakers.  and 
good day. ladies and gentlemen.. my name is . and it's my comrade . and today our purpose is to. tell you about our research. and discuss it with you.. (er) so. . do me a favor and start...
(er) on screen you can see our. research structure. and now we are going to start our. speech.. nowadays. there are a lot of. (eh) computer games. besides traditional computer games.  multiplayer computer online games are becoming more and popular.. many of them are free.. and companies (er) get (er) their revenues from (er) selling diverse number of (er) additional functions and (er) game tools.. now. more than ever. gaming industry is at the heart of the.. entertainment business.. there are now. mo= more than (eh) two and a half billion (er) gamers across the world.. combined. they spent around (er) one hundred and fifty two (er) billion dollars (er) on games in twenty nineteen.. of course. you can see (er) forecast rise (er) of the next three years...
this year. the Asia Pacific region. produced game revenues of. seventy two (er) billion dollars. accounting for forty seven percent of the global total.. China remains (er) the most important market in the region. for the coming years... over the past decade. (er) online games (er) have become. have become one of the most. (eh) important components of modern popular culture.. at the (eh).. at present. the number of registered users (er) of (er) different games. (er) are (erm) higher than (er) the population of (er) different countries. you can see on the screen... there are a numerous objects in literature (er) that are known as objects of virtual property. for example. you can find (er) in-game facilities (er) some (er) unlocks of. virtual objec= real objects in the virtual world. such as (eh) second life harbour hotel. and so on...
so. as a part of our research. we have conduct. conducted a survey. (er). among the students. and. so. results you can see on the screen... (er) (erm) as a. as for results. (er) our survey. showed that most respondents. (eh) know about. such a problem as. virtual. objects. thieft. in. online games. about. fourty. percent of them. have been victims of this. crime.. (erm) so. objects of theft were mostly expensive. and despite this. people do not call the police. as they reckon that stolen. items can be brought back. even .. (er) according to the respondents. user agreement protect their right on the Internet improperly. and it is essential to. enact law. that will regulate their regulations. on the Internet...
the possibility of (eh) legal interference in the (er) regulation of relations in the sphere of computer games. is. highly disputed question nowadays.. (er) one of the main issues (er) which (er) needs to be resolved is (er) whether law should. get involved in virtual processes and protect (eh) gamers from the. unilateral actions (er). that are acted by. right holders and other users. who steal virtual property.. there is.  (er) circle test (eh) your can see on the screen. the essence of (eh) which is that. virtual relations. subject little regulations. (er) if their participants (er) can anticipate (er) the real. consequences.. on the one hand. we are talking about (er).. relations. in the virtual world. about the game. (er) whose nature is (er) to give. give a gamer an opportu= opportunity. to act in a way they want in a real life. but on the other hand. (er) it is about (er) objects which have real market value. and relations. that are. but of the real life of real people...
. issue. so. (er) in Russia relations. involving virtual property. in most cases are not judiciously protected.. one of the. reasons is that  qualifies the relations in. M M O games as gambling and betting based on the following articles.. so. (er) as you see on the screen (er) and I will pay you. I will ask you to pay attention that. according to law (er) a gamble is a risk based agreement on the price. so howev= how= however. virtual forms. of entertainments. are deprive. of the most important criterium. of games and betting. and risk based agreement on price.. they don't even imply any winnings. don't have any and. moreover. none of the existing user agreements include a. clause on winning. that's why we reckon that it. is. incorrect to apply this qualification to the sphere of online games. as it leads to virtual property. not being legally protected.. (er) for instance. even Taiwan's. Chinese. and Denmark's legal systems extend property. right to virtual objects and prosecute virtual. thieves. and  under criminal law. in a conventional manner.. (er). it has to be mentioned. that Russian courts are gradually beginning to notice. the differences between. the virtual content of online. games and the gambling. in the ni=. in the context of article (er) ten sixty two. of the Russian civil code.. (er) whether or not will be supported by other courts. only time will tell...
there are. three ways of legal regulation. (er) of relations. associated with (er) virtual property. (er) the first way is (er) from Russian property law.. it's a well known fact. (er) that. an item. of property. in Russian property law. can only be an individual item.. so. virtual objects. cannot be. (er) regulated. by property law because of their intangible. nature.. the American doctrine (er) vice versa. suggests (er) that (er) common (er) property law. should be applied to objects of virtual property.. (er) supporters of this doctrine. claim. that. (er) virtual objects. are intangible objects of (er) a special kind. occupying an intermediate position between intellectual property (er). objects and (er) standard objects of property. right.. (er) another point of view is (er) by. the professor. of Bryanskiy University. . he says. that the term property. is often used. in legislation. but does not have a clear definition.. in the current civil code of the Russian Federation.. this term is used in (er) different meanings (er) you can see on the screen.. so. we can (er). so we we think that . virtual property. (er) regulation. can be qualified (er) as property right. (er) according to this classification...
so (er) professor of Higher School of Economics (er) in Moscow of offers his solution.. (er) the existing pluralism. both. in the legal doctrine and in legislation with regard. to the meaning of property leads. to the conclusion. that it is co=. that its content may. vary. according to the circumstances.. (er) so. the category of (er) property. can be used as flexible. (er) as possible include new objects that are somehow involved in properties' regulation.. so. (er) out solution. that we offer.. our. that we offer. our own s=. (erm) project. we suggest (er) add a new chapter. to the Russian civil code. as you see on the screen. (er) which will include the following features. such as. definition. general provision. process of acquisition. ownership and its use. disposition. restraints. in the. right. of. use. and exception of virtual property.. (er) 
(er) in any case over time. the need to revise the traditional concept of property rights. (eh) its objects and. the order of their protection. in order to classify virtual objects will arise.. due to the current trend of (er) dematerialization and. property virtualization. relations. arising in virtual worlds. are increasingly difficult to interpret (er). in a way. that is inherited from. Roman law... that's why. experts agree. that sooner or later codes and subsequently leg= subsequently legislators. will be forced. to recognize (er) the reality of. virtual property in. Russian legislation...that's all. thanks to your attention...
thank you.. any questions
well. guys. thank you for. (er) crucial issue. for. revising crucial issue on this topic this question. and (erm) now I'm interested in. your personal opinion. in. the next question.. (erm) how you suppose (er) should we. adopt (erh) several new. legal norms in order to. (er) implement. the concept of. virtual property in. (eh) civil code.. or in current situation we. can deal with. concept of virtual property and protect it.. so. the main purpose. of (em) your study. is to show how to protect.. if I real=yep
clearly understand.. so. should we. make new norm. adopt it. or.. should we use. current. legal order..
I think.. I think that (er) we should (er) imply. new norms (er) in Russian legislation system. because (er) current is (er) do not give an opportunity to (er) protect rights of the gamers (er) in. online games (er).. properly (er) and some objects that were stolen. (er) can't be. brought back. even judicially...
may I continue..yeah...
(erm) in that case. we have (erm) open list of (er) civil law objects.. right.right..
(erh) and.. don't you think that (erm) in current legal picture. we could use this instrument in order. to protect virtual property.. (erm) about (mm) half year ago. I made a study dedicated to. (er) legal regime of. (mm) digital. moneys.. digital currencies.. and. I found out that. the main instrument. to implement this concept in Russian. civil (erm) law. civil code. is the opened list of. (erm) civil law objects.. so. why can't we. use this instrument. in order to protect virtual property. can we or we can't. and why...
I think (er) that. it is hardly possible to. use some (er) norms about.. currency. because. it is (er) the (mhm) mean of bank and (er) it's not an object of. some. property (er) and (er) it has different types of. regulation. I think...
(mhm).. well. (erm) . . thank you very much. that's really (er) highly discussible today. (eh) will be. the nature of (er) the virtual property.. well. actually I've got some questions that. I hope. would (er) help you. to continue. your legal study.. well. you told us that you read. some articles of . yes. if I'm not mistaken. well. is also. (er) our colleagiate  Higher School of Economics in Moscow. and he. has got a lot of. not a lot of. but some good articles (erm).. in.. in his book about the electronic commerce. that probably could help you. and let's   from Saint-Petersburg. State University also have. also has a lot of articles that could help you to. continue. your. analysis.. and I. had some questions concerning the. legal cases in Russia.. have you analyzed some of them...
(er) we have analyzed (erm).. this case (er) by. Leninskiy. district court of Kemerovo (er) where. the judge decided to.. equate (er) the virtual property to. common property in (er) Russian legislation. and (er) other. decisions of (er) courts were.. (er) have restricted (er) the.. compliance (er) of (er) ci= citizens...
there are some cases. where (er) judges decided to qualify. this issue as (er) (er) as an article two s=. two seventy two. the. criminal code. the and illegal access to. the protected information. so. probably you can find some more cases there.. and there is a very good case. Federal tax service versus Mail.ru Games. that was in the Supreme Court of Russian Federation. that's why you should. well. definitely look at it.. and there is also. well. some. some goo=. point. that you could use in your research.. well. thank you
