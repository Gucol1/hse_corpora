our. last but not least speaker.  who is going to talk. about. something. quite complicated from my point of view. is the effect of the carrageenan on rats' G I T. so I have no idea what it means. but  
 would affect. in your. (er) presentation. hope  something
would be. what 
i hope it would be very successful
(mm) yes. it is... good afternoon. dear colleagues.. my name is .. I'm student of. Chemistry and Biotechnology Department. from. Perm National. Research Polytechnic University.. today I will you about my. scientific research.. the. effect of carrageenan. on. rats' G I T... let's talk talk about food additives.. the use of food additives. is. widespread in modern world.. food additives are positioned. as harmless.. (er) while. their components. affect. the... affect the. physiological processes. particularly ones. for. like.. . in. G I T.. also. food additives may. affect (eh) influence. to.. instant.. microbiota. and. (mm) ... what I want to talk about today. is. carrageenan.. it is used as. stabilizer and thickener.. you may find i=. found it. in. dairy products.  products. jellies. (mm) maybe some confectionery.. researchers from. around the world. are still study the influence of carrageenan on. mammals'. G I T.. there are two major groups.. people who claim. the se of carrageenan. and people who don't ... so.. despite disagreements. (eh) the=. there is. maximal concentration. of carrageenan. in. products.. according to. World. Health. Organization. the maximal concentration is one percent.. it is. it corresponds. with (eh) this corresponds to Russian San Pin... we have.. a big group. of twenty rats. to determine. the influence on their G I T.. ten rats. from. experimental group. eat carrageenan in. concentration of one percent. and. the other ten. do not.. (eh) there are. five males and five females in each group. that guarantees. that this microbiota. were evaluated from both group. in both groups. since the. sixth of November.. now. we can see some. changes. in both groups.. so let's. start with blood parameters.. normalization of that parameters. in different ratios. analyzed by. component. blood count. and by chemical analysis.. wait.. experimenta=  (eh) males from experimental group.. lighter than. males from control group. and females from experimental group. are heavier than. females from control group.. and this is microflora.. in both groups (mhm) we can see.. lactobacillus and different bacterium decreased.. in different ratios. (mm) in both groups.. the end of the experi= experiment. will be in March.. now. it is difficult to say anything certain about. danger of carrageenan.. because. all the results. within normal rates.. thank you for your attention.. I  really happy to. answer your questions
my  I didn't. what is carrageenan... what is
it is food additive. a stabilizer. or thickener..
is it natural or not
it is (er) people. it is natural. you see. Red (er) Sea.
seaweeds
sea= seaweeds
and (er) like food industry are using it
yes
 it  funny 
 if they use it. what's the point. for your research.. if they do  before using this. in food 
because there are different. facts about. (er) danger of carrageenan
so they use it but it's dangerous
they use it in concentration of one percent. that's why World Health Organization. (er) discuss. every five years. about. the.. danger of it
uh. so it's not good
it's not good in peak concentrations.. and. the one percent. it is. it is ok.. but sometimes.. there are discussions
and another question. is it enough to. speak about. ten. rats. only. doing an experiment like that
(er) in my experiment.  twenty rats
n= no one experimental. and one group. te= ten rats. they 
 control group and experimental group.. cause I may take. more rats but it's expensive for student
speaking about. scientific result. is it 
it is ok. it is enough. enough
it is ok . actually it is depend on the field. 
yes of course. (eh) you may. use mini pigs. monkeys. humans.. but. first of all. we use rats
is there something new in the  or 
what 
like this experiment
(er) I think there are. yes there are different experiments. (eh) the people. study the. different concentrations... (mm) maybe one. to fifty percents. and. but I never see.. I never see  of microflora. in the experiments.. so. we. try to. study. how the microflora. a microflora of G I T. will change. would change
my question would be about statistics because I know that people from natural science use statistics
yes
and I as far I understand this work is in progress and 
is in progress yes
and do you are you going to use some statistics in order to establish significance between the experiment and the control groups and what kind of coefficient do you use
coefficient between rats and human
no no coefficient between the control group and the experimental group in order to understand significance statistical significance you should count. well you should make T test to maybe. some other statistical tests. no
we we have blood parameters right this is microflora in the March we will make gastro= gastro analysis
ok. but how how are you going to conclude about significance statistical significance of the resluts
we have to we have to analyse datas
but you don't know how
no we haven't got enough results because this is intermediate results so in the end we can absolutely do it
ok and I'm asking what yeah coefficient do you use normally
like. what 
 say because we don't do it yet ok
because sociologists for example use normally T tests for example. or ANOVA analysis and something like this
we don't do it yet because we we haven't got enough
I'm actually asking about future about the future
in the future we will do much work
ok. any other questions.. so. thank you very much.. thank you to all the presenters.. all the presentation were very different and very uni=
