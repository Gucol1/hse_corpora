so the context digital economy the main factor company's success nowadays the availability data appropriate for decision making however the growth rate the data that needs be processed increased constantly increasing (er) thus companies need tools for data analysis and here cyber physical systems can help this the first aspect (er) the (er) our research motivation the second one that modern buildings are (mhm) used extremely inefficiently (mhm) electro appliances are left turned when not used then there are operating modes for heaters and (um) and on and the third aspect that available the market solutions are (um) characterized (mhm) propra= (er) increased requirements not only personal but also operating conditions that is very complicated it's complicated adapt them for (um) buildings that why develop cyber physical systems Higher School Economics and define them class information systems that integrate computational elements into physical objects the goal the research to create the architecture cyber physical system (er) this will lead (er) the least four benefits the first one that (er) the cost will reduced the (er) energy consumption will reduced well and (er) the (er) comfortable environment for the personnel will created comfortable environment (er) mean (mhm) the climate outs= inside the building the temperature the air quality the light and many other (er) aspects create (mhm) architecture reviewed some related works and (er) mentioned they are really hard adapt real buildings (er) they are not free-distributed and they're very expensive that's why they (mhm) are not really good for our aims (er) create the architecture is necessary define (er) functional requirements the system two main functions were identified the first one cost reduction and the second one the creation the comfortable environment inside the building for each (er) the main functions lot subfunctions were identified can (er) discuss them three levels the level physical object which the office the level digital twin and the level interface the first its (um) physical object this level system should collect data fr= (er) inside the building might (er) temperature metrics (mhm) data what (mhm) about the energy consumption and many others the digital here this slide some the sensors that collect data that mentioned (er) introduced for example the right there sensor for temperature measurements (er) the digital twin simply digital copy the office (er) is where data processed is responsible for predicting system behavior collecting information about possible (mhm) failures predicting potential (um) accidents one very important requirement for digital twin reale= the realization energy optimization and the last level its interface just the interaction the user with the system taking into account all these requirements this architecture was proposed (er) the most interesting part here application server course (er) includes not only some usual units like control unit and data collection unit security unit but the distincting feature this (mhm) architecture that proposes the unit for energy consumption optimization (um) moreover I'd like tell you more about (er) the highlighted components they are responsible for mathematical (mhm) experiments (er) the digital twin that mentioned earlier consists three components the first one 3D model the office the second one mathematical model and the third one real data (mhm) collected from the object physical object the highlighted components (er) help realize the digital twin the first one free CAD is software that (er) used create a3D model the room then open modelica software that helps stimulate the mathematical experiments and then and Python are used for data analysis (er) then (er) the system architecture was and system functions were introduced hierarchical structures and (er) the upper side we observe functions and (er) the bottom the (mhm) slide (er) can see elements CPS and they are connected this structure helps (er) identify what elements (er) are responsible for what functions the system then value engineering houses was implemented order (er) reduced costs and maintain even improve the quality the proposed system here can see ... we can't why all right let wait minute two will work few seconds (er) wanted show you results the value engineering method implementation (er) (er) made possible propose some (mhm) advices for the system (er) order improve (er) reduce (er) here is (er) reduce the cost its realization here can see (er) (er) god illustration (er) bars (er) gray bars are responsible for the significance functions the system and black bars (er) are (mhm) the cost realization the elements that realize these functions and here can see that for some elements the cost much much greater than (er) the significance the function for example the third element (er) it's mobile app (er) after looking this picture decided that it's too expensive but not very significant and proposed replace by web application (er) that adapted for mobiles devices (er) thus the function system control (mhm) with help for mobile devices was made cheaper and let's get back the digital twin here you can see model the room where cyber physical system implemented gradually our university (er) currently have eleven sensors that (er) collect data (er) and temperature different levels the room then control system for lightning and for window curtains are (mhm) implemented this room well (er) the second (er) very important part (er) digital twin mathematical model created model that illustrates (mhm) experiment heating open modelica software the first experiment when heater does not have any operating modes and (er) the temperature the inside the building the red line fluctuates well the temperature outside the building this means that energy consumpt inefficiently however when (um) create some operating modes might some conditions when heater not (er) working (er) the situation changes and see that despite the fluctuations outside temperature the inside temperature the red line remaining remains constant and finally the third part the digital twin are real data data collection (er) realized with the help the platform thingsboard and collect data temperature and visualize with the help this platform however has much more (mhm) potential features that will use future (er) here can see that when open the window we when open the door the there huge drop temperature while the heater still working with the same power (um) it's evident that energy just wasted here are some more graphics the same data collected (erm) and conclusion would like mention one more time that the significant feature this system that proposes the services for energy optimization and (er) (er) (er) combines several software solutions for mathematical experiments (er) that didn't manage find any related works and this system can used (er) within the conteps context digital transformation the building the city the economy general (er) thank you for your attention (er) I'd like answer your question you have them 
okay is your system with such architecture (er) scalable and (er) adaptive adaptable
yes is currently are working just one room but this system can (er) adapted the whole building the whole
 is scalable .
yes
and adaptive
(erm) what you mean adaptive
to (er) self-adapt self-adapting system with property self-adapting
you mean change (er) course is (er)
 adapt consider conditions changes
(er) yes (er) the components that introduced they can replaced other components there such need for example mean yes (er) se= dex the arch the architecture adaptive we can (er) replace any component change them order (er) we get any new requirements
what element architecture critical for this (er) for this system
it got 
for example is destroyed and the system
fails yes think there are (mhm) the control unit the central this system but however also got (er) security unit case this unit fails also won't (um) work properly the system won't work properly control unit (er) responsible for managing everything this system it's essential
do you know research projects this area (uhu) you know projects any
yes have made (er) a research and found some examples similar
it's research projects industrial
research projects yes (mhm) found them (er) proceeding some different conferences triple conferences and researches propose this architectures (er) these solutions for the same problem
there are many many product idea
yes course there are much more but
are they interesting ... (heh) ... not not only 
yes course just because can't show more this just one slide
can you compare toolkits can you compare (mhm) what advantages disadvantages
the main disadvantage that (er) these structures these architectures not propose any energy management solutions they are considered only internet things they (er) provide different solutions for light control (mmm) like smart (er) houses realization but the energy consumption not considered these architectures
but will considered
in our will be
was that the reason why you chose this particular (um) project
yes
 mean lack information some particular subject
(uhu) are working energy management with our professors (er) our research papers our thesis are aimed energy management that's why tried (mhm) implement our knowledge the field cyber physical systems
thank= thank= thank you very much
