well. speak here please. yes. well. this kind recorder don't touch it.. well
it's ok.. (er) can you just... K... (er) so. (er) good afternoon. everyone. (er) did research. about. artificial intelligence.. (er) what I'm going to. present today actually still. only its early stages. but. really suppose tha=. suppose that findings. far. are still worth tell you.. (er) artificial intelligence machine intellect. which different than there (er) than the natural intelligence the humans and other animals have.. moreover. is the. (er) researches (er) that help. the environment. and the industry. that they could work faster and grow rapidly.. (er) people seem be either excited. worried about the future impact artificial intelligence.. personally. can understand both points view.. fascinated developments artificial intelligence. and (er) say the same time. apprehensive about its possible negative effects.. (er) so. and all us. know that. every technology has. its benefits and its drawbacks.. but advantages the technology (er) advantages the technology. always outweigh (er) the disadvantages survive the market. and (er) nonetheless. for artificial intelligence. are not sure whether. the long term period (erm) are positive effects will always outweigh the negative ones.. (er) (er) so. let start looking. some. advantages.. and this slide. You can see some real life (eh) real life artificial intelligence examples. (eh) the one hand. the increase in. intelligence technology should bring some obvious benefits.. machines are clearly able do many jobs better than humans can. especially areas. (er) that require. high levels ac= accuracy or. calculations using large amount data.. in. for instance. (mhm) large amount robots have already been developed. that can carry out surgical operations and. procedures with greater precision than human doctor.. (eh) and. all us know that. already have self-driving cars (er) just. for example. Tesla ca= Tesla car.. (eh). yes. and (erm). such technologies can. (er) improve safety. by. (eh) reducing the likelihood human errors.. and. is easy imagine how these developments and many others will steadily improve our quality life.. but. (er) course. there are some weaknesses. such. unique technology. an I.. (erm) the one hand. share the concerns people who. (er) who believe. that. (er) artificial intelligence may harm us. we are not. careful.. the short term (er) is likely that will see rise. unemployment rates. (er) workers various industries (er) are replaced machines. robots.. for example. self-driving vehicles. (er) may cause. redundancies. in. (erm) driving jobs such as. taxi drivers. (eh) lorry drivers and. for instance. bus drivers.. (erm) you took about medium term fear (er) have say that. (er) intelligent. technologies gradually take jobs away from humans (er) may find. (er) that. people. (er) will lose the sense purpose life.. and. longer term fear. that computers become. intelligent. (er) that they begin make decisions without. human. oversight.. and some words about artificial intelligence. investments.. (eh) humans are focused. the because. they understand and know. that robots can give them. (mm) benefits and make task performance easier for them.. there are. lot companies (er) who are investing I technologies.. so. following graphs and various data. about. T companies (er) which are focused and paying attention towards. the (er) artificial intelligence technologies (er) yes. that's the idea. and you can see the graph (er) just for the first column. (er) there are about (er) two hundred and fifty three companies. for. machine learning. and just for instance the second column. (er) there are. about. one hundred and fifty. four. companies. which are investing artificial. artificial (er) intelligence technologies.. (er) K.. and (er) are very close the end. now. but. there are. just. couple things. that. want cover and. tell you.. (er) so. you have understand from speech the main conception and the idea. that. I combination mathematical analysis and. (er) (mm) and. (mm) learning. and all learning algorithms. fo= focused planning and forecasting.. so. now want to. (eh) show you project (er) which was written the. programming language. Python.. this project called. (er) Football. and it's (eh) short video it will work.. will hope that.. please. please. (eh) (er) please. work. work. no.. it's. small. oh. God
change the program.. change the program. change the instead (er) Windows (er) Media Player. change 
but is. is time cons= consuming and that gets. delay lot participants. but what have do.. want present O K.. and (er) it's really pity.. this project called Football.. and. this program. according. maybe. can... can show maybe your computer. not. it's just
a bit later. now (er) your presentation
but without video. because is. th= last part my presentation.. so. (er) (mm) this program. is program. according my opinion. good example of. simple artificial intelligence.
and I. have already mentioned that. (er) artificial intelligence combination of. mathematical analysis and predictions. based the previous experience. (er) used these approaches. my program.. and they yes (mm) wrote two tactics.. the first one was for goalkeeper. and the second one was for attacker player.. and (er)
can you show maybe (mhm) no
maybe think. would be. quick.. just because. the video is. for. is. twenty.. seconds.. ... ... yeah. works.. it's. good.. right... K.. see you can. yeah. wasn't. wasn't (er) it wasn't easy you can imagine just. because. have to. (er) have to. predict and forecast future movements. my. opponent.. and to. write. proper. proper algori= proper functions to. predict the. their movements and. this wrote. two tactics for. (er) goalkeeper and for attacker player. and. it's yes.. (er) and. what have say conclusion. (er) (er) the. conclusion. while intelligent machines will doubt improve our lives. many ways.. the potential risks such technologies. shouldn't ignored.. and (er) thank you for your attention.. feel free ask any questions.. sorry for this (er) (mm) problem this. technical
ok.. the questions
yes.. please
(er) so. understand. you are the first course (er) Business Intelligence.. here. right... K.. (er) would say that.. as.. criticize. you know.. and. believe when say. everything. everything. every word that I'm going say for you.. you can better.. can say that your presentation was very good. but what want from someone who specialising. business intelligence. so. want you be excellent. presenter. first all. the movement. the movement. you should like. move. better.. you are not good. just move (er) you know. know your perimeter. and. know. where. like. where look. K you just was focusing on. like 
but. but teacher
I know. know.. you were presenting just for you.. just let me. let speak and then. I'll give you all the time like
so the idea that teacher has. told that. have communicate with the audience. and see not just not one directions. in. several directions and. did. this way. did. like that views was like ok. ok
your presentation said. and your language. was really good. one the best. students that I've. spoke English with. and I've listened to. because you were (er) same (er). O Internet Things
yes Internet Things
and (er) for. the record.. if. and only if. you practice forth. think that by. year two. you would one the best presenters one the best.. and and give you. really. like. big plus. for the (er) video. that you did. cause. know exactly it's exhausting go about such thing
yes was really difficult and complicated 
and there another.. just one thing. usually. try. methods presenting. like methods.. you can. can give you idea since you are really listening you know movie of. Johnny Depp.. (er) was. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
yes course
and you will. K why he speaking about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory because of. the fear that you. said you spoke about. the end your presentation. you said that. K are. are going face. maybe. unemployment. problem so. it's right but. human being. evolve. human being. develop as the father the. the. you know the main character of. the Chocolate. Chocolate Fabric. his father. became. not the operator this machine. became. (er) with like. someone who maintain this. this kind machine. human being. developed themselves.. and this the way that are going to. survive.. thank you very much
well. any questions. the topic the presentation.. any.. is really possible trust artificial drivers.. wonder
(eh) can you repeat please
well. it really possible trust. artificial drivers.. robot artificial driver
(er) so. (er) this technology (er).. (er) isn't so. spread today. today. it's just. develop. and maybe. the future. (er) will (er) will stumble upon this technology. just (er) outside and see self-driving machines. but for example. Perm and. and. similar. cities. we. think (er). will not. will not see this technology like. self-driving cars.. these technologies. you. you've seen.. think local areas. today. and course. will danger trust. trust these technologies (er) we. have work. have. have to. work lot (er) have to. work lot to. develop to.. improve. these technologies trust them
thank you
your research in applied camp. just apply to. sports industry (er) well. what the practical implication. of. this particular program. it first step. creating more and more. (er) can you. apply it. right now maybe to. something else. not only predictions their. steps somewhere else
it's really interesting question.. how answer.. maybe.. maybe. maybe. some sphere you can use. these. these algorithms. and these. theory. (er) just for example. (eh) the medical sphere.. for example. I read the article (er) which. which. was. written. something about that. (er) robots. implement some programs. and the. basis. illnesses. our patients. and according some. thesis statements. (er) we. we. conclusion. and understand the diagnos=. diagnos=. yeah. for the patients. and. think. is good idea u= use this approach not only not only football but the other spheres
do you envisage. the perspective your research.. what it.. would like continue
(er) perspectives (er)
yes
you know. it's really. interesting topic. and really interested machine learning. big data. like data science. and. my. my. jo= my. work is. did literature review this. work also. did. yeah. and.. maybe yes. will work this
O K.. thank you.. thank you that's great
maybe delete this video. just case. 

if it. it. crash your computer
it's not mine. it's High School Economics
yeah
thank you
