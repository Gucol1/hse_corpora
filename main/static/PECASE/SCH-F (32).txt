 uhu okay and well welcome 
 very nice presentation question so you mentioned you showed those posters advertising from war times and I'm more familiar with the USA advertising course and it's history to you those times war the advertising gets little more controversial you look back after the war to you what the what the distinction what the difference between something that simply social advertising and something that propaganda 
 (em) 
 are you familiar with the word propaganda 
 how can understand well the advertisement the social advertising and propaganda it's said there we've got lot propaganda our world nowadays well think all people agree all countries the USA Great Britain Russia well all countries now and the past had lot propaganda well how can distinguish propaganda and social advertising 
 think (em) when advertisement begins was like propaganda (em) the past yeah and (em) think this connects maybe propaganda and social advertising because when the past people (em) 
 well think well it's only opinion think social advertising can quite useful well for society for people against smoking for example smoking and propaganda well it's seems me it's quite negative course maybe it's good for countries but general negative if we've got your study think it's like recommendation distinguish yeah two things and perhaps analyse positive aspects social advertising and negative aspects propaganda okay 
 okay
