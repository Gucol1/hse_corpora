 and intellectual property the fashion industry...
hello. so. our topic patent law and intellectual property the fashion industry...
in recent years intellectual property rights. have played pivotal role the growth the highly competitive fashion industry. which generates about. two trillion dollars per year.. when considering interrupt intellectual property within the fashion industry. the most notable challenge handling the protection numerous designs seasonal basis...
the addition new industrial designs fashion line can also protected by. (er) patent.. this refers any product that has distinctive visual features.. our work explore ways protecting intellectual property the fashion an. industry. well carrying out comparative analysis. the regulation this sphere different countries.. focus. the liability. arising from. (er) intellectual property infringement (er) and (er) study detail examples such violations among well-known brands...
copying the fashion isn't new. and key players (er) the fashion industry almost constantly face. accusations. (eh) plag= plagiarism.. (er) sometimes such accusations are. for advertising purposes only. (er) and some and enter into battles (er) social networks. social networks. order compete.. (er) for instance. during New York Fashion Week. (eh) famous American designer. Alexander Wang. (erh) caught (eh) his Instagram page. caught (er) famous German designer Philipp Plein (er) in. copying style and scenery. (eh) others. however. bring their cases trial with the real financial consequences.. (er) where the line between inspiration and illegal copying someone else's work. and there. legal protection against plagiarism...
in Russian law. plagiarism understood the most. (er) common method copyright infringement. namely the appropriation the autho= authorship (er) an item. and all the rights held the true author.. obvious example plagiarism the fashion industry copying. product design...
(er) from the point (eh) view Russian law. plagiarism difficult prove.. the Russian civil code establishes. presumption authorship. (er) copyright designer arises virtue the fact its (eh) creation an objectified form. without requiring. (eh) any. formalities. such registration.. however the lack such formalities makes difficult prove. that. the design the product has been copied.. addition. even small changes. may indicate new. intellectual result... seems that over time. (eh) jurisprudence will able breach the gap between (er) copying someone else's work and. (er) creating new one under the influence other works.. (er) but now (er) is. difficult. (erm) to reveal general trend...
in addition copyright. the appearance product can also. protected an industrial design patent.. obtain protection. the appearance the product its significant features. must new and original..
to sum up. should noted. that Russia. the design product protected co= copyright.. (er) the product is. the result. the author's creativity. (er) and intellectual work. and patent law. the product unique.. addition. believe. that would better improve the registration procedure. (er) because (em) despite the fact that. patent law (er) much more effective than copyright law. (er) is very long and costly...
European countries. have two tier system for. regulating this issue.. (er) there national legislation and general legislation for all member states.. the first country where the protection the copyright fashion designers. was expressly provided law was France.. French courts. (er) is. not uncommon for. French designers take legal action against manufacturers committing plagiarism.. thus back nineteen ninety four. the lawsuit Yves Saint Laurent. (er) brought against the American designer Ralph Lauren. connection with the violation of. (er) the plaintiff's lost rights. the tuxedo dress. was considerate and satisfied.. according the court's. decision. the defendant paid the plaintiff. total of. three hundred ninety five thousand dollars... directive. (erm) the European Parliament and Cou= Council nineteen ninety eight. legitimised. (er) tion a. special design law. all. member states.. the design product defined as.. the appearance all part the product due features and particular lines. contours. color. shapes. (erm) textures and materials. (em) and ornaments...
however. European legislation based. the need protect copyright. clothes and the fashion industry. the United States not the case.. thi= this not. the case.. the fashion industry. the second largest industry the United States. after the financial industry.. (er) there are more than. eight hundred (eh) fashion companies. the country.. the same time. there no law. (er) the United States. that protect clothing rights.. despite this. the design products. the United States. can be. protected cou=. court copyright (eh) precedents (eh) patent law. (eh) for example. the design ver= ver= Vernetta bag and Crocs. (erh) and their design. can registered. trade dress.. for example. (eh) the red sole Louboutin shoes. and Tiffany's blue packaging... however. copyright. protection the United States. ineffective...
first based the ian. concept (erm) utilitarian concept of. clothing. and other fashion products.. United States copyright does not protect the author's personal rights their design.. model clothing general.. the conceptual separation test. developed by. the practice American courts. also not always objectively. applicable determine. the tactics. the. subsequent protection truly unique and creative work. fashion design.. result. most cases. the design clothing. (eh) accessories. can copied without. negative legal consequences.. this regard. many brands resort.. to. other ways. protect. the rights to. their original product ideas.. for example. the famous Birkin box from. Herm√®s.. are registered. the. United States trade dress.. such vigilance. allowed the French fa= fashion house in.. (em) twenty twelve collect losses of. one hundred. million dollars from three dozen websites.. for selling fake copies...
with the advent. the Industrial Revolution. when production volumes began gain. unprecedent proportions. (eh) companies began develop trade dress. (er) the asso authenticity. products. was now. (eh) determined (er) patent name. (er) the clothing industry became for manufacturers illegal (eh) copies. because clothing was. the most (eh) demonstrative way. make statement the public. look. can afford it...
in the mid. two thousands. Burberry. respected British brand. with long history. was. the verge. bankruptcy because marginal. individuals from disadvantaged (eh) English areas. which severely. (er) affected the company's. image. bought fakes. with branded cage... (er) in.. two thousand four. eighteen percent. all counterfeit products. the world. were those with the. Louis Vuitton logo.. the way. this brand. one the most copied far. along with. UGG and Rolex.. for example. forty million fake watches are produced annually. which means that the brand loses about. six hundred. (er) million dollars..
in two thousand and four. Tiffany sued eBay. claiming that. eighty percent. the products. their website. with their label. were fake.. (eh) the same story happened two years later.. (er) with the fashion conglomerate V ninety percent their. (em) products. displayed eBay the Louis Vuitton. Dior. and others. turned out be fake.. the way. the company then won the case. and eBay had pay compensation. sixty three million dollars... the problem counterfeiting course. doesn't apply. only. luxury brands.. (er) black market complete. without Adibas sneakers Nice. instead Nike. and Lacoste Polo with crocodile. that looks like (er) as.. it... it were staffed with hormones. (em) two thousand eleven. more than twelve million copies. all products sold under the Adidas label. turned out be fakes.. (eh) the way. original Nike sneakers cost about one hundred and fifty dollars. exact copy (er) such sneakers. produced China. costs of. thirteen dollars. and then sold for sixty dollars...
thus the regulation the rights. clothing design one the least harmonized. areas intellectual property law.. unfortunately. there no univer= universial way. protect against plagiarism. the field design.. moreover. plagiarism. fashion. can both. intentional and accidental.. and the line between open copying and inspiration very thin.. the comma will put (er) the curt. (er) the court. depending the. circumstances. particular case.. this case. recommend promoting the idea plagiarism. and the use fakes an anti-trend...
of course. some people believe. that not everyone can afford buy. expensive thing.. there nothing wrong with wearing and buying fake thing. things.. however. you buy clothes. from fake producer. you will. (er) support illegal activities. and the number fake things will increase. (er) which will lead to. loss your. favorite designer's profit...

 thank you very much for your. good presentation.. well. I'm focusing. intellectual property my legal practice. that's why this. (em) theme very. interesting. for me.. well. and wanted ask question.. you think that trademark protection. also one good instrument to. well. protect your design. to. fight against the counterfeit..
yeah. thank you for your question. (eh) believe that trademark. is. also one the most. (eh) useful.. methods. protect. your products.. so.. is used. well.
especially America..
well. actually and Russia. because well the (erm) the question of. it infringement the trademark. the easiest one between the questions.. iIs it. infringement your copyright.. patent.. well. can ask one more question. well. actually. you said that. it's better to. improve the registration procedure. Russia concerning the. patent.. of. the patenting (eh) industrial designs. right..
yes
well. probably you've got some. purposes. how can. improve it...
speaking frankly. believe. that. is necessary create. international system of. (er) (eh) protection this sphere. but (eh) Russia. (erh) this process is. quite long and. costly because you have to. (eh) learn lot information and. probably have spend your money go the. special. places. bureau. patent bureau. (erh) believe that (mhm) there is. lack of. (eh).. laws. international laws...
what about the Hague convention. concerning the international registration process. (eh) industrial. designs... well. it's not that popular. the Madrid agreement for trademarks the patent cooperation treaty other patents. inventions. well. however. there one. there one. the Hague convention gives possibility to. make your registration easy. and get the patent the two countries.. well. however. agree with you. that it's not that widespread other conventions.. therefore. (erh) probably. should.. well.. influence other countries. entry. because Russia part that convention since. two thousand.. eighteen.. I'm not mistaken. nineteen. something.. well. thank you once again for your presentation
