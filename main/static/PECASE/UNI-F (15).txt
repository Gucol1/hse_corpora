 thank you ... how harmful is in terms social effects only hear about the good stuff the news 
 (er) ... what you mean 
 you think that when you watch news and you only see the good things you think that makes the things bit hidden everything fantastic 
 .. (er) another things anything the news can negative (er) sure but (er) but the site the news are at= (erm) . ... user the website can see all news negative positive full format full volume (er) but (er) social network (er) said about Vkontakte because Rifei Perm used only Vkontakte and YouTube channel on these channels can short version and don't know why it's the only positive well (er) citizens use Vkontakte like feedback and think it's like conversation between company and users followers 
 thank you for your presentation and question how the results you've obtained can (er) used for example for the advertisement agencies the marketisers these (er) how can they use this information
