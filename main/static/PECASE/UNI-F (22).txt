clandestine organization the same name Krasnodar and its partisan work the state directly put put pressure the creators this movie make set convenient example behavior since movies their opinion were the strongest tool for influencing person (er) for many Soviet citizens the people the young guard was (er) historical document that what actually happened those young people shouldn't forget that the attention was paid only ideological standards and not the personalities the characters their actions were often devoid emotions and personal experiences they acted the state needed expected them (er) life was constructed constant accomplishment feats and the communication between characters occurred only within the framework heroic achievements (er) here appeared (er) the image team performing (er) next movie consider Naum Birman's the chronicle diving dive bomber is also story both the Second World War but there are some crucial differences here people just have their lives and (er) this

the norms social realism showing person who does the wrong things hero (er) Detochkin's image associated with being infantile he's not angry aggressive his shoulders often bottom (er) has awkward gate behaves like child his mother here is presented new way is based theft (er). the film doesn't just exploit the idea the image Robin Hood but through the sympathy the viewer shows that justice an integral part Soviet society this movie that shows reality ambiguity person the screen giving the viewers some food for thought (er) now it's time Leonid Gaidai's diamond hand (er). analyzing the image the main character (er) can see that doesn't is not traditional hero (er) (name the character) senior economist (er) judging his clothes his apartment his social status pretty high which doesn't correspond his (er) behavior behaves clumsily gets lost which creates the image symbol has wear hero mask that doesn't fit him all the revelations the movie appear they occur through that tell the

I'm sure you have seen the diamond hand many times and you understand what the (er) role .(er) protagonist Andrei Mironov very antisocial image but now our times these protagonist may seen like hero our times hence .is possible say what this times the Soviet cinema can step step regenerate because the anti soviet protagonist maybe very sympatic don't believe that this was good reason believe that was just some new tendencies can jump in? but listening your presentation was wondering whether it's possible make any cross-cultural comparisons about images movies the nineteen sixties can you paraphrase the question paraphrase repeat should paraphrase the question should put differently should just repeat paraphrase please it possible compare images soviet movies with images for example American movies the nineteen sixties French movies English I think that was the nineteen sixties was (er) the USSR's would like twenty years ago thirty (er) (er). was more like something internation think that really can't compared images presented the Soviet movies the images see like American movies the nineteen sixties yes can you give any examples example concrete moves that can compare with movies from another countries but you can say though It's not area my expertise will think about thank you very much we'll think about next time right yes will think about any other questions that's (name the presenter) thank you very much thank you
