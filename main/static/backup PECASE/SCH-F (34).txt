 well thank you very much  great presentation well will you stop your demonstration and questions you are welcome 
 so you had a very nice presentation I liked it and I thought your topic is interesting and (em) I have a lot of opinions honestly on social media whatever it’s more positive or negative so I would like to know your thoughts on social media today and whather you think it’s largely positive or largely negative and what else can be done to improve it in addition to creating accounts and presence that have a positive influence such as you presented to us 
 I think that social networks it’s like two side theme  but if we use social networks we should use it in right way for example students can hav can search some information which will help in their education in their future like in my project for example it will helps students to know about healthy lifestyle 
 thank you 
 okay well thank you next question please 
 thank you for your nice presentation so my question would be could you give any general recommendations for other health centers what’s from your case could be applied to other health centers maybe not student health centers but other health centers to improve people awareness of different health issues 
 okay nowadays most of health centers publish the information only about vouchers about the organization not some useful habits which people can use in their real lives so I think that health centers needs to pay more attention to . useful information on their social networks like some tips some information about healthy lifestyle and so on 
 thank you 
  you mentioned that social networks should be used in the right way but do you think it is possible to control the use of networks . how people can use it in the right way  
 maybe it depends on users because everybody changes what he want to see what he want to do in the social networks it depends on users 
 well thank you very much
