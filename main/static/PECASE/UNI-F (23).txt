 our next presenter and the title her presentation different wars the Second World War the educational standards Ukraine (er) twenty ten twenty eighteen (er) (er) hello name and (er) (er) want present (er) the part my previous research (er) it's about (er) (er) topic (er) researched (er) the images the Second World War textbooks but (er) the educational standards (er) course are (er) related (er) these (er) the images the Second World War (er) (er) different wars beca= (er) because it's question like (er) (er) whether (er) they have changed not (er) through= throughout this period (er) and (er) want start with mine meth= metho= methodology it's better say the language description because actually based (er) several researchers (er) regarding cultural memory (em) either (er) Ukrainian (er) (er) (er) both Ukrainian and (er) English (er) papers and works about this topic and for this particular topic need to (erm) terms (name the researcher) (er) this researcher (er) working cultural memory and models memory the contemporary war and there are two models (er).. collective remembering (er) because it's (erm) it's stated that (er) memor= (er) that society has collective memory and kind special frameworks which (er) (er) which construct some (er) memory society there are two models remembering (er) remember by itself I'm forgetting and there are two types (er) remembering the coherent there are not (er) pure active remembering pure (er) (er) passive rem=(er) remembering (er) active remembrance the societies (er) (er) because and have (er) the proper translation Russia because also (er) canon about what should learn for example our te= from our textbooks official what you should learn from our literature (er) who's specifically (er) described our textbooks our you know museums and on and archive about what should preserve and keep (er) special institutions for example it's something that available for specialists like historians (er) and these events and this (erm) part history (er) doesn't (er) exist society but only scientific (er) institutions and the particularly and the particular point that (er) researched (er) some standards. four standards and they regarding (er) the national exams they (er) constitute what (er) Ukrainian contemporary Ukrainian schoolboys and schoolgirls should know when they passed (er) when they (er) have exam .(er) the end their education (erm) school as have Russia (er) in their whe= (er) there are four standards (er) we (er) (er) have gone through step-by-step through them (er) twenty (er) (er) the first standards (er) was was written (er) twenty (er) ten (er) so there (er) can can't (er) (er) there no requirements (er) for for Holocaust knowledge and understanding the Ukraine Polish conflict that very essential because Ukraine and Polish conflict inside the Second World War still controversial and very (er) (er) discussable point (er) was for Polish and for Ukrainian society (er) second point that there are abandons victim it's rather victim narrative (er) rather he= he= (em) (erm) like the narrative vic= victims (er) first all and there are also pan= pantheon heroes (er) for the state and image can called due the use the soviet cliches there lot them (er) (er) can say that (er) for example the inclusion western Ukraine nineteen thirty nine but actually that the USSR and German (er) divided Poland not (er) Ukraine there no Ukraine before mean like there was part in (erm) (er) the part Poland the se= the second example contribution the Ukrainian people the victory nazi it's quite common (er) cliche for soviet narratives the Ukraine and Belarus too our text books either (er) (er) moving the second (er) was written twenty fourteen (er) can see that there new topic which appears these standards topic Holocaust (er) think that's probably because (er) you know like the cause (er) remembrance the Second World War contemporary Europe concentrating Holocaust topic (er) and can see (erm) (er) but can't see the participation (er) Ukrainian nationalists for example (er) Holocaust but you see just kinda this event and we can see those persons Ukrainians who (er) sacrifice their lives just (er) tried help (er) Jews Ukraine so the second deportation Crimean Tatars can strongly (er) can strongly can strongly related with political situation because you know interfered (er) just this year it's required know more dates and demands regarding and anti military events the territory Ukraine during the Second World War here don't have actual explanation this about (er) standards we can see that there more requirements dates and particularly events (er) (er) the Second World War the third standard (er) what was written (er) after two years and just after two years quite small period would say and again (erm) observes there (er) this role from the soviet narrative just (er) very strong shift from the soviet narrative national one (er) we still ha= have some soviet heroes and Ukrainian soviet partisans (er) also (er) now invasion (er) have such terms reinvasion the Red Army mean the (er) the eastern parts Poland as it was called western parts Ukraine we have term exclusion the German invaders from Ukraine (er) also there there Ukrainian Polish conflict but there's (er) comparing (er) comparing with Pola= Polish narrative about this war would say that textbooks there lot (er) points view you know that there (er) Polish (er) historians (er) which opinion presenting (er) the textbooks there (er) some Ukrainian historians which are also represented the textbooks (er) good but deserves still now explanation the conflict mean like kinda justification (er) the conflict (er) because (er) Polish (er) memories considering that was genocide the Polish and Polish side doe= does not suggest like war but actually there was (er) war and there still controversial (er) discussion about that (er) the ne= the last one national narrative expand expending here and victimization even intensifying (er) the like into con= like the conclusion this the kind memory the Second World War was actually great and and now the Second World War could not interpreted patriotic anymore Stalinizm was equated with nazism (er) nazism (er) least nineteen thirty nine and the tactics scorched land (er) there can see the tendence which (er) obviously the most Eastern Europe country Eastern European countries (er) have now it's narrative two occupation two occupations from nazis nazi (er) Germany and from the soviet (er) from the soviet Union (er) and the the last standard was written also only just two years after the the previous one and can there's just (em) such shift (er) I mean like very dramatic shift from the previous one but (er) yes can see continuation the same trends (er) and even deepen knowledge about the war (er) mean like there requirement (er) learning heart more dates more names and (er) new terms appeared (er) like concentration camps (er)  but I should (er) say that (er) (er) appeared textbooks before there term (er) (er) population Kiev and (er) surroundings Kiev that (er) (er) were sent the front without (er) proper equi= equipment (er) and there was lot there was high percent died persons and there point (er) that the the contemporary Ukraine (er) (er). want remember about kind one the crimes soviet regime and (er) Ukrainian liberation movement also expanding narrative the standard (er) and there are lot (er) personalities lot own personalities and poor representatives the Ukraine nation the most important political events it's quite interesting because for example (er) (er) those (er) those fighters are diplomats who took parts (er) for example raising flag over the Rei= Reichstag signing (erm) the peace (er) document with Japan (er) (er) who who organized (er) partisans France there are the national (er) their textbooks there are lot references those people who (er) give take (er) to= took part the war around the world the soviet Union in conclusion would say that (er) obviously there great shift from the soviet national narrative with some details know can say that pan-European approach this mean (erm) Holocaust (er) first all just memory war within eight years and the rapid change the canon (er) (er) have seen it's also has changed and some from the archives there mean for example (er) when (er) (er) twenty fourteen there (er) put off the topic deportation Crimean Tatars (er) for example yeah (er) ready answer answer your questions any questions from the audience  (er) should (er) should operate with (er) the terms Sandarts give opinion scientific please  your opinion I would rather stay scientific terms terms yeah (er) though think the every nation they try (er) try create their own narrative course any country (er) pass through that and I think that ... (er) the terms narrative seems very coherent mean like now there before started research this (er) topic think that (er) thought that (er) what they have like know like because didn't (er) (er) learn at schools for example but actually they have some topic.that can arise from the archives to (er) create rise this coherent history the Ukrainian nation nation maybe Belarus have has not lot such stuff because because just the= ther= their international light was died seventeenth century think yes the eighteenth century but (erm) that's (er) what the Ukrainian historians (er) (er) make make more science more ideology now actually course depends institutions on scientists for example (erm) based (er) some scientists who actually Ukrainian Ukrainian working Berlin University in Canada in the (er) and course there like Russia maybe every country there there are (er) historians don't know how say like different groups course for example who works who were for example intonational instead memory yeah (er) there are lot of course historians who wrote those books and lot them had lot soviet past example and (er) there one Ukraine historian (er) (er) wrote (er) his work about historians and their opinions about soviet past too and they're crucial moments that some them (er) change their position through the political fluctu= fluctuations can ask question what extent this research biased what extent (mhm) can paraphrase what are the limitations this research (mhm) yes ok  (er) probably there (er) depends so studied textbooks first all course we are studying memory the society so this position looking through textbooks and give gives this understanding what country what Ukraine (er) how Ukraine how does Ukraine (er) sees the politics memory their country but (er) not limited because out schools and there more freedom schools for example some schools can (er) use another textbooks (er) for example textbooks which were written (er) nongovernmental into your textbooks will help here (er) and there limitation this because course should ask for that point view (er) people (er) teachers and (er) school school children about their memory and their social frameworks historical frameworks memory it's also possible to research (er) this politics memory through standards and textbook and wanna also point that there are lot textbooks compared Russian case cause for example for tenth grade there there six textbooks only for six text books for international history and six and about (er) (er) about inter= (er) don't know like the connection and international history too haven't (er) looked through all them but that's why shou= wanna constrain myself standards thank you very much thank you very much for the wonderful presentation
