Introduction
Background. The one man company is the new legal institute (for the first time it appeared in England: the first precedent - The Principle Of Salomon – was dated 1897. In other countries companies of such type have appeared only at XX century). Because of that this institute is not settled, there are gaps in legal regulation of one person company activity which provoke controversial points in practice and intentional abuses which injure rights and legal interests of other people.
Problem statement. In consequence of problems created by imperfection of the one person company and its legal regulation the purpose of this paper is forming by the author her own opinion about validity and necessity of existence of such type companies and, if the opinion is formed to one man companies, to offer the methods of this legal institute improvement. For achievement of this goal the objects are set in this research:
1. Investigation of the structure and the organization of work of one person companies in different countries (countries from Anglo-Saxon legal system and from Roman legal system), realization of comparative analysis of them to choose or create the most effective system of one person company activity;
2. Revelation of advantages and disadvantages of one person companies, problems of the legal regulation of them in different countries, the establishment of general problems of one person companies and proposal of some ways in order to improve the investigated institute, particularly in the Russian Federation.
Professional significance. The term of this resources has rather practical direction because the main problem of the one person company is the contradiction between the actual state of such companies and the legal nature of legal entities. A lot of scientists note such illegal features of one person companies as absence of collective feature that contradicts the nature of legal entities as collective subject of civil relationships. So, the solution of this problem must eliminate such contradiction between practice and law.
Delimitations of the study. The focus of this paper is the structure of one man companies and the organization of their activity in different countries, the revelation of advantages and disadvantages of such companies in different countries and their comparative analysis. The main focus is the legal gaps in legislations in different countries, contradictions between the one person company nature and the nature of legal entities, the investigation of other countries experience with the purpose of fulfilling the legal gaps and solution of other problems.
Definitions of key terms. One person company (or a single member company) is a company formed by one person or having only one person as a member.
Project Proposal
Literature Review. Different authors analyzed the legal institute of the one person company and formed different opinions. Some of them consider that such companies have the existence right and are independent participants of civil relationships with their own advantages and disadvantages. The one man company is rather profitable type of the legal entity for a conduct of a business. In comparison with other legal entities (as limited liability companies or joint-stock companies):
- It is easier to establish the one man company because it needs less quantity of resources;
- It is easier to reorganize such company, if it is necessary;
- It is easier to manage the company of this type and to control it, because actually the control is accomplished of the management activity only of one person;
- It is profitable with relation to economic sphere because the single participant of such company uses the status of the legal entity which has the creditors’ confidence to a greater extent than participants of civil relationships without status of the legal entity;
-  It gives a possibility to obtain some indulgences in taxation;
- It gives a possibility to limit the responsibility within the bounds of the contribution in the property of the company.
(These advantages are revealed on the basis of:
- normative acts: Acte uniforme relatif au droit des soci?t?s commerciales et du groupement d'int?r?t ?conomique and others;
- Internet-resources: Entreprise Unipersonnelle ? Responsabilit? Limit?e – EURL; What are the pros and cons of 'One Person Company' (OPC); One person company Pros and Cons; Advantages and Disadvantages of One Person Company; One Person Company Meaning, Features, Pros & Cons).
Some authors draw attention to other advantages of one man companies: for example, Janet E. Morrison  marks such advantage that investigated companies have the simplified procedure of succession (succession on death – the company passes into the hands of heirs).
These authors admit that one person companies have some disadvantages like:
- There are some limitations in the procedure of such company establishment, reorganization and others;
- It is not always easier to establish the one man company (as compared with the private enterprise);
- Profitability of such companies is ambiguous: the member of the one person company can not derive benefits from hirelings;
- Taxation with indulgences is entrusted the single member, not a group of people;
- Responsibility with limitations is also entrusted the single member.
However these scientists mark that such disadvantages are economic and organizational and such types of disadvantages are in legal entities of different forms, so each member decides him- or herself which form of legal entity is more profitable for him or her.
Other scientists think that one man companies can not exist because their nature contradicts the legal nature of the legal entity, its collective feature. The legal entity functions on the basis of concordance of the members’ wills and formation of the common will which is the will of the legal entity like the independent subject of civil relationships with respect to its members. Achievement of this in the one person company is not possible because in such companies there is only one member the will of which coincides with the will of the legal entity. This contradiction causes other problems which have more practical features. For example, the internal structure of such companies is artificially tied to the internal structure of legal entities (with several members). That is, the existence of management organs, which are necessary for function of legal entities, in one person companies is formal because practically all decisions are made by the single member (in some companies which have only one member obligatory management organs are not created at all because of irrationality of their creation). So, practically the majority of legal norms about legal entities are fulfilled by one person companies only nominally or are not fulfilled at all. Reasons of that are the nature of one person companies itself and marked problems in legislative regulation of such type of companies. Such indetermination causes different abuses: for example, such companies often are more appropriate for representatives of big business than of small business, and firsts use these companies for money order, evasion of taxation legislation and other abuses.
Consequently, at present time there is not the common opinion of scientists about validity and necessity of such legal institute as the one man company. On the basis of comparative analysis of such institute in different countries it is possible to make the conclusion that the scientists from countries which are in the Anglo-Saxon legal system treat one person company negatively. It can be causes by the fact that in such countries there is a principle of dispersion of property (in companies there are a lot of owners with not great shares in the authorized capital stock). On the contrary, the scientists from the Roman legal system countries treat the one person company more positively. It can be produced by the principle of aggregative property which is the characteristic feature of countries from Continental legal system (there are little owners with great share holdings).
Methods. For attainment the aims of this research such methods as the investigation of the object from its general features to its private characteristics were applied. For investigation of the structure of one man companies there were the analyses of legal entities forms, methods of their creation, than the types of established management organs, the order of their formation, etc. In the paper it was also used the comparative method. It permitted to compare one person companies in different countries, the structure of their management organs, their function and authorities, the institute of one man company with others (with private enterprises or legal entities), etc. This method was used to determinate the problems of such legal institute and on the basis of experience of different countries choose the ways of effective improvement of the structure and organization of activity of one man companies.
Results Anticipated. The one person company as the legal institute is incomplete. It contradicts with other legal institutes and creates the possibility of abuses and violations of law, legal rights and interests of the participants in civil relationships. Because of that it is necessary to forbid the creation of one person companies or to improve this institute by moving amendments and creation for one person companies their own regulation different from legal regulation of other companies and legal institutes using attainments of other countries. Thus, the one person company earlier appeared in England and its legal regulation in this country is less contradictory and more effective (for example, the Companies Act assigns the possibility of function of the one man company only with one management organ – with the director). 
Conclusion
The one person company is the controversial legal institute and for this time scientists did not form the united opinion about it. Some scientists suggest that it has its own economic and organizational advantages and disadvantages as any other participants in civil relationships. But some scientists indicate that disadvantages of one person companies are more serious: the legal nature of single member companies contradicts the essence of legal entities, etc. This investigation of the one person company institute revealed that this institute is immature. It was formed at the end of the nineteenth century and the legislations in different countries have some gaps in legal regulation of the one person company which, in their turn, created the possibility of different abuses, violations of law, legal rights and interests of the participants in civil relationships. Consequently, the institute of the one man company without any changes or improvements must be forbidden. But on conditions that on the basis of the comparative analysis of this institute in other countries the institute of the one man company can be improved (for example, by moving amendments like in England - the possibility of function of the one man company only with the director as the management organ, etc.), it must be improved.
