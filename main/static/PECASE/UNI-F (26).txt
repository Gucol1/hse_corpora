dear participants. dear jury member let (erm) thank you. again. for attendance. for. organ= for organise. this section (em).. current analyze would dedicated. (eh) twenty twenty. Constitution amendments.. (er) January twenty third (erm) President draft of.. Constitution amendments (eh) was. adopted (eh) state duma Federal Assembly Russian Federation. (er) first reading.. today will (mhm) revise some crucial issues.. which (erm)... which are. listed (er) this draft and (erm) the= would. try prognose. (er) the possible consequences (em) which would.. (erm) which would appear (erm) this draft would be. adopted.. (eh) here the general plan of. report that first. would the general info. on. ways to. alter Russian Constitution. the. second point to. analyse the (mhm) group amendments. and (er) the third group would to analyse the controversial issues. which.. I've. found. during the (mm) analysing. the Presidential draft. and.. after that. we're going discuss some procedural moments.. (erm) as. general rule. now current relevant (erm) law situation. current Constitution have. three ways to. alter the. Constitution norms.. the first is. simple iteration.. this way. (mhm) could applied. only for. article sixty five of. Russian Constitution. then.. second way. (erm) would say the (mhm) the most.. using.. most. (mm)... most applied way (erm) to. alter the Constitution norms is. (er) adopt amendments. and the second. is. the most radical. the third. I'm sorry the most radical. to. revise. all the Constitution text.. (erm) can apply only (mm) chapters one. two. and nine Russian Constitution.. (erm) result (er) President. project. President draft amendments. analysed I've.. found out several groups. alteration. and the first. dedicated (erm) rising social guarantees.. (erm) and the two two main points these alteration equm= (er) equalising. size minimum wage and (mm) of. subsistence minimum.. and the second is. mandatory. indexation of. (eh) pensions.. the second group. (er) alteration dedicated judicial system. and (mm).. the most. radical maybe. alteration. is. (erm).. decreasing number. of. Constitutional. court judges. from nineteen. to.. eleven.. the. second alteration this group is. (er) giving the.. Federation Council (er) credentials resign. judges (er) reason misconduct. (em) another reason.. it's the. open list of. basis. reasons. and (em) I've decided. that there is. (eh) several risks. but the main risk is. (eh) Federal Council. (er) colle=.. sorry.. collegial body (er) collegial governmental body. (erm) there no. procedure to.. makes. make this decision.. there no procedure to.. (mhm) rules. how. what quantity. shou= wh= needed to. (em) accept adopt. such decision. and on.. (erm) the third group is.. alteration. is. dedicated to. risks of. alteration international law priority.. currently. we. according with. part. fourth. for (er) of. fifteenth article of. Russian Constitution. have. unconditional. priority. international law.. but (erm) the production of.. article seventy five President. Presidential draft. (erm) says that.. (er) Russian Federation has powers. not (er) to... a=... sorry (mhm) has powers not to. execute (erm) the. norms international treaties. which.. are. con= controversity the national legislation.. (erm) the main risk see this norm. (mm) that (em) would lead to. revised the Constitution.. (erm) revising the Constitution I've said before. is. the most radical instrument. alter the Constitution. and would lead to. adopt the new Constitution. the se= separate new act. and to. avoid current Constitution all. ban it... (mhm) well (er) we.. came to. basic question of. current study. current analysis (em) so. what way alteration would chosen.. (erm) many questions. many issues. was risen due the fact. that. amendments would be.. (eh) in.. would adopted. (erh) (er) whole national voting. referendum.. (em) but referendum is. (em) current. legal way adopt new Constitution. to revise. not to. adopt amendments (erm) there as= separate way. to. adopt amendment and (mm). whole population of. Russian Federation. don't take part this process. (erh) have. reasonable doubt. we have (er) would we. would. be. chosen amendment of. main way alter. the Constitution we would. revise. (eh) our current Constitution and. adopt new Constitution... (erm) and. main consequence I've.. noticed.. (erm) you let me. I'll make an.. statement.. lot risks. lot of. (erm) alteration. which would (erm).. adoption of. these amendments. will lead to. (er) the Presidential draft keeps (er) list. of.. more than. twenty. Federal statute and Federal Constitutional statutes (er) dedicated to... this amendment (er) and they should be. (eh) altered. result of. their adoption.. so. it's not. just simple process. it's not just (erh) way to. alter one document. whole the national legal system Russia.. would. (erm).. would be. altered significantly. and crucially. extremely. would say. so. (erm) I'd be. glad to. analyse it. I'd glad discuss with you.right now. thank you
thank you. very much. thank you any questions from the audience
(er) don't you think that (er) our country. just (er) already situation that. national rules are higher than the international rules.and. this. (erm) (mm) (mm) speech of. Putin just will
just will approve it
just establish that this situation and (mm) that. the article fifteen (er) just for. for fun. and it's not applicable for right now. don't you think. (eh) so
you've reminded (er) President with (eh) European court Human rights. when Constitutional court (eh) had. several decisions. dedicated to. this question. and it. (er) declared. that. Russian. Russian Federation. capable of. not execute. not execute the decisions European court Human rights.. but. the whole (er) should say that (em) simple bending of. international law priority. would lead to. (er) isolation again. would lead to. I'd say.. crucial. extremal consequences. (er) right the moment I'm incapable of. saying that. it's just (er) simple. declaration. (mm) all us have lotta. examples. knows lot examples. when. (er) the priority international raw. of. international law. sorry. true. obligatory and mandatory.. (mm) but totally agree that. there a. significant. exceptions. this rule
well. I've got question. thank you. very much for your presentation.. well. I've got question. what are your favourite amendments. that you talked about.. what would hope to. become law. and become part Constitution
we are talking about (er) strictly. draft. strictly Presidential draft (erm) I'd say that. there are several amendments. among this list. that I'm not negative. I've. I've described it.. for example. (er) determined but. Presidential draft. (er) keeps. such. amendments (er).. requi= strict requirement to.. (er) people serving in. state and municipal. services. that they shouldn't have. (erm) foreign citizens. that it. that they shouldn't have (erm) any legal base to. live in. another country for long period.. maybe would lead to. more loyal serving.. to. our country.. maybe. would useful. maybe. would. (er) deny decrease. the.. corruptional factors. for example
may be.. well and. the last question (erm). was about.. the real reasons for these amendments.. what ar= you think that. there are some. well. vital. reasons.. Russian society. that should amend the Constitution the way that President proposed it
we can.. are capable say= uncapable. sorry. saying (mm) this strictly. but. there's always doubt. but for social guarantees for. instance. say that. it. would.. the reason adopt these amendments was.. objective.. (eh) there were. lot trends that. labor pensions was not indexated. it continuing. and (mhm) the level life. the economical level life. has decreased significantly since. twenty thirteenth so. (erm) I'd say (em) lot these amendments. was caused by. objective trends. objective situations but.. maybe (erm) for judicial system alteration. for rising credential President. (er) would. some scientist call it. the signature. norms of. signature prodicts. signature norms
what you think about. the situation. around. the. maternal capital.. (er) would to possible to. adopt and (eh) what can the. sources of. such amount money
you were late. was dropped since the january the first.. we'll se= will already have. far understand. (er) maternal capital for the. first child. first born child. (em) guess the reason. of. (eh) this adoption is. much more economical and social. cause.. now (erm) the generation nineteenth. should parents. in. current tense. and they were. significant. social.. decreasing number population decreasing. (eh) Russian Federation nineteenth. it would lead decreasing again.. pool.. gonna have. social pool again. and it's just instrument (er) for. not make su= this decrease. such significant. such extremal. would say. and for. amount. yeah. would be.. guess would hard. really hard (erm) the same time with. making obligatory. to. indexate pension.. so. I'd say our budget should work more effectively.. more and more effectively
I was independent the Constitutional court internal federal law. and the new proposed amendments (eh) show. that they work independently. and self-sufficiently. where what you think that would change (er) the role (er) the Constitutional court
today morning I've been talking associate professor (eh) (eh) private discipline department of. Moscow Higher School Economics and he. suggested to read his article the por= the portal and. talk= told little more things (em). his point view. accordance with. suggested articles. is. that one the highest risks.. to.. bend the principle of. (eh) court independence the whole.. because (em) in. current Constitution. (er) the questions. the issues of. judges' resigning. are. (mhm) decided. (erh) regulates. by. judicial command. so. judicial command decides who should resign. and why. should resigned.. accordance with Federal Constitutional law. Federal law. and. another. Federal Constitutional law and Federal regulation. the whole. but. making (erm) open list. th= the first thing that. list reasons. the. what President would.. (erm) supply. Federal Council. resign. this that. judge. open. it's not closed. so. it. would. maybe. this that situation. would cause to.. (mm) misconduct. would. would lead misconduct
