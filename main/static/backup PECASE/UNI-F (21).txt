  the first presenter will be (name) with the present with the representation of the image of a woman in the  society of the nineteen seventies welcome   hello my name is (name) I am a second year history student here Higher School of Economics in Perm and my research seeks to explore how the image of women was represented by the society of the 1930s the studies and analyses normal lifestyle of women created in the 1930s by as a woman work and journal as you can see is a problem statement on the slide the theoretical basis of my research was first of works on the government's policy regarding women by Goldman and Minaeva who have been actively researching the materials of the woman work a journal secondly it works on the struggle for the rights of women in the USSR by Richard States and thirdly as research into the life of soviet citizens by Levina and Osokina. the sources of data are articles from the woman worker a highly authoritative and influential magazine for women in the 1930s  these are articles on the life of soviet women in general on working women and on the participation of women in political life of the country and then this is of the women's issue on the bush week agenda In recent research the following attitudes of historians towards a women's issue can be observed Richard Stites believes that Stalin was an anti feminism because of his upbringing and  traditions but at the same time he shared  on the woman as a labor resource and a colleague of a man Minaeva argues that by the 1930s thanks to the propaganda of the 1920s as  (er) and readers of the woman's work and journal were beginning to show independence they had been put forward an idea that by the 1930s the authorities tried to (er) construct new social norms by creating a new service sector . Stephen Godkin introduces the concept of speaking Bolshevik It is the language of self identification which served as a barometer of political commitment and finally Wendy Goldmans. she says that (er) in the 1930s the state (er) created a certain apparatus for (er) retreatment to provide new labor force and there was no control over this process by the authorities .. the a state constructed a certain image both with a working environment and for everyday life .initially (er) .the state constructed an image of urban woman is the process of industrialization and her social roles took center stage . the increased number of working women exacerbates the issue of motherhood the soviet policy had a strong influence on the upbringing off children and the government created an image of ideal mother using the tools of agitation and propaganda as a state in the 1930s created an updated ideal image of the soviet Union Additional complications since the 1930s were hunger poor yields and scarcity the changing social roles of women in the USSR in the 1930s first role can be defined as a woman with a party membership card and as a participation in political activity was seen as indifference to country's problems .a woman in a managerial position became more frequent occurrence because the feminization of the state of appraises began a woman has  for socialism an arbiter of events a sports woman a successor to her husband's business competent and free from the constraints of any archaic traditions those were meant to be the main functions and goals for a woman in the 1930s on the cover of the August 1931 issue you can see two women reading a book woman wearing a white scarf is probably a white shawl is probably from the village a peasant woman . and the woman on the right is probably from the city a woman worker this means that women these diverse social backgrounds can be literate and is striving for soviet female happiness is demonstrated. an image of a woman in everyday life initially women were held captive by household chores until the soviet government turned women's family routine into a common household by the end of the 1930s women's responsibility for raising children was recognized. letters from women complaining about their life testify about women being burdened with their daily routine  they wrote letters to the editor so they could enter a communication with authorities. a woman who earns a living was not uncommon for that time . the concept of factory line schedule should also be mentioned in this article about the ideal family this says that everything should be done according to the schedule and parents and say children should even make the work contract as you can see  from the working environment was transferred into the family life . the image of a working woman . an exemplary woman was supposed to have certain qualities and to be provided with certain options one of them was having having an access to new professions a greater number of women joined city councils village councils (er) working brigades shop brigades and they worked as (er) equals judges so it was a big step forward is the process of emancipation of female labor finally women were granted some economic rights and women in their struggle for the best performance they turned into super productive  workers encouraging others to exceed production targets . and of course the state provided an opportunity for a woman to take a leadership position or change her career. to summarize the above the following conclusions can be made. in the 1930s the woman worker journal was aimed at was aimed at using propaganda to make women join the Communist Party presenting patterns of behavior for women in various fields of activity and the emancipation of women in the process of industrialization.. women were give some new public roles which created a portrait of a soviet woman . she was politically literate capable of acquiring new professional skills and supported by the government. family life finally was taken out of a closed autonomous space and thrown into the sphere of public relations and the involvement of women in work was achieved through the inspiring articles about the successful women who were able to change their lives. thank you for your attention I would be happy to answer any questions you might have   can I start. will that be OK  could you move to the slide . with the roles of women in business or something   this.   yes this one thank you very much could you expand on your last point please and give me an example of a woman being a successor to her husband's business   in the 1930s women finally started to be like a separate person from her husband so a woman could do more than she could in the past and for example. the covers of the woman worker journal were with woman who inspired others so for example woman who were on the covers they inspired their husbands their husbands too  to do what   if you are on the cover of this journal you are an ideal woman    all right thank you very much what are the implications of this research do you talk about implications of the research and history you do all right good what are the implications of your research    paraphrase   ok now it's 2020 why is it important for me to know about an image of a woman in 1930 in the 1930s    Nowadays of a woman of a woman are changes now social ruoles change now in the modern world so it is very important now to know how it was then and why this process is happening again   thank you very much  any questions   I have two questions first you write the word business what does it mean business in the socialist society because the word business is the word  world   here I meant some activity of the husband not business like in the capitalistical (other sounds) no of course not   Like  money   and the a woman who makes money the equal situation makes money (russian speech)   it means that   to earn (russian speech)   (Mgm) it means that she earns a living she can do it herself  it's  of the language but a very important question what is the difference between feminization and emancipation. the difference between these words   In the context of the feminization of the state  means that more women could leave the country and emancipation it is the usage of female labour   because the western world feminization and emancipation have many common senses .. in the soviet Union the situation was different   yes of course   any other questions. no  thank you very much for your  presentation
