 (em) believe that antidotes for cauterizing fluids can found everyday life and effective providing first aid the prehospital stage basing this assumption aim the research evaluating the effectiveness various antidotes for poisoning with cauterizing substances and develop information booklet the first aid case poisoning the research objectives are presented the slide the subject study was household (em) antidotes and their effect against cauterizing substances (em) the first substance investigated was potassium permanganate according literature the antidotes potassium permanganate are ascorbic acid and the mixture hydrogen peroxide with acetic acid antodote tested ascorbic acid powder the powder was dissolved water and added solution potassium permanganate equivalent amounts complete decolorization the solution was not seen however when excess ascorbic acid was added complete naturalization potassium permanganate occured next tested ascorbic acid tablets (em) it isn't comfortable for to change the slides like this (em) что такое 
 well you shouldn't well it's (uhu) 
 the required number tablets was calculated they were crushed and dissolved water the resulting solution was added the solution potassium permanganate complete decolorization the solution was seen the next antidote took vitamin complex the form tablets containing vitamin the tablet was dissolved water and equivalent amount potassium permanganate was added the purple color disappeared is known that ascorbic acid (em) found citrus fruits we tested orange and lemon juice sorry isn't the right slide (em) an antidote juice was squeezed out the fruit and one milliliter five percent solution potassium permanganate was added partial disappearance purple color was seen the last antidote tested was mixture hydrogen peroxide and table vinegar when equivalent amount potassium permanganate was added the mixture the purple color disappeared however this mixture has unpleasant pungent smell vinegar and the reaction was accompanied the formation foam therefore this antidote not recomend for use young children shouldn't taken orally the next substance studied was iodine according literature the iodine are sodium thiosulfate and starch when tested sodium thiosulfate (em) the form injections solution accompanied disappearance color the iodine solution was seen the next examined the starch solution starch was diluted water and added the iodine solution the disappearance brown color and appearance dark blue color was seen after diluting the solution became clear that the reaction had gone completion the next cauterizing agent examine was acetic acid according literature the antidotes are sodium bicarbonate antacids and milk (em) first all prepared soda solution and added equivalent amount acidic essence it the reaction took place very quickly with abandoned formation gas and foam this confirms the fact that soda cannot taken orally case acid poisoning this can lead stretch the stomach tested the results solution for acidity with licmus test which revealed natural medium the soda solution can used treat the skin and oral cavity next examined antacid using the drug an example (em) half bottle almagel was added one milliliter acetic essence and the reaction the medium was checked the acetic medium hasn't changed the same result was obtained after adding the second half the gel the last antidote was milk one hundred milliliters milk was added one milliliter acetic essence the reaction the medium remained acidic after adding two hundred milliliters milk the reaction the medium also remained quite acidic based the results the work the following conclusions can drawn literature the given topic has been studied potential household antidotes for poisoning with potassium permanganate iodine acetic acid have been tested has been shown that case poisoning with potassium permanganate ascorbic acid preparations from home first aid kit powder tablets vitamin complex citrus fruit juice can used first aid for oral cavity treatment and ingestion (em) mixture hydrogen peroxide with vinegar can used only for the treatment the oral cavity adults case iodine poisoning a starch solution can used for oral cavity treatment and ingestion (um) food containing hybrohiden hydrates can given case poisoning with acetic acid the soda solution can used treat the skin and oral cavity you cannot take soda inside almogel and milk are not very effective but they are safe and can used before the ambulance arrives partially neutralize the acid also made booklet on Russian Russian language for Russian people here is the slide also (um) list literature thank you for your attention 
 (uhu) well thank you very complex topic for well questions you are welcome (uhu) well you've got question (uhu) 
 thank you was very informative have two questions (em) maybe some provocative and but would like have your opinion that you testing the frequency (em) with the visual inpecion the color the solution my question if add antidote and coloration disappears does that mean that the solution now completely safe drink that's first question and the second question what will more dangerous have acidic (em) poisoning and wait for doctor to take soda but have side effect stomach stretch in case don't have anything else and just soda my house what would better wait for doctor to take soda 
 if you will begin your second question you ate acid acidic you have only soda and you ate a poisoning fluid you should wait doctor because soda you cannot use inside all it the only way you can help yourself to wait doctor (em) and the first question forgot what what
