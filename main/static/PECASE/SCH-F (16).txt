the planet the methods my research are collecting data quantitative survey questionnary the analysis the survey and personal experience today the Earth currently facing lots the environmental problems the poisoning the world's land air and water the fastest spreading disease off our civilisation different environmental groups all around the world will play big role protecting life our planet one the environmental and social group movement zero waste movement adopting zero waste lifestyle one the most sustainable ways living the term zero waste was first publicly declosed the nineteen seventies Oakland California today the popuarity the movement continues grow zero waste have significant benefits for environment and economy zero waste movement focused solving different problems but however the most dangerous thing for our planet plastic plastic everywhere like love because is waterproof cheap and durable but most people really think about the effect has the environment and like other materials never really goes away and cause dramatic poisoning the world's land and water during research made this survey and asked several questions more than two hundred people from different ages from fourteen seventy five years old living Russia the USA and Canada according the results the survey can see that most the respondents are aware environmental problems and most the respondents about eighty four per cent Russia and more than ninety per cent abroad know that their daily habits affect the environment nevertheless every second them Russia and more than seventy five per cent abroad don't ready refuse these habits improve the ecological situation also can see that most the respondents don't know anything about zero waste movement there are different ways one can practise zero waste lifestyle tips everyone can use move towards zero waste movement are refuse reduce use recycle and now i'd like share personal experience participating zero waste movement all started examining plastic packages i found out the information that film not recyclable and was astonished the fact that practically all food and supermarket wrapped into film nearly everything usually buy the supermarket sold into plastic i got shocked the number plastic you use every day came with simple experiment i decided cut the amount waste and refuse number non recyclables experiment lasted for week. firstly bought clothes back for shopping secondly stopped buying food the supermarket and instead it went shopping the market located five minutes walk from house order avoid using plastic bags for food bought ecobags are made from clothe online was unusual for shop assistants not put food for sale into plastic bags but was persistent and they got used it also stopped using plastic bottles for water i replaced them with steel one which can used for years i started thinking about the college my everyday life i read lot about the ways minimise using chemicals home for example started washing dishes with the help soda (eh) finally tried buy less amount food avoid throwing the left always away despite all the taken measures can't but mentioned all the difficulties had face first all couldn't find all the ingredients needed without plastic packaging one place took long time go from shop shop search them also lot goods plastic are much cheaper i also couldn't avoid using shampoo shower gel tooothpaste and on without plastic packaging all the alternatives are not easy find they are expensive must made ourselves out natural ingredients but (erm) sorry summarise the all mentioned above i have come the conclusion that i really satisfied my abilit=ability i really satisfied and I'm confident my ability maintain new lifestyle i have come the conclusion that achieved the purpose my research work and improved that zero waste lifestyle possible but is long process and need lot efforts and preparation but now I'm surely can say that zero waste movement an excellent way improve the ecological situation our planet and every person can participate it thank you for your attention. 
well maybe can yeah make little comments thank you that was very impressive talk. you very emotional and was obvious that you're very passionate about this topic. (erm) (erm) my question well maybe it's not kind question it's (erm) little suggestion that might make you talk even more impressive and that (erm) that might future (erm) make others join this movement that thing you talk would much more convenient you add some (erm) numbers saying that okay I've tried live one week without zero waste and look before (erm) used throw away (ah) let's say three kilos plastic every day I don't know. how much did used do that? just (erm) and now I'm throwing zero if multiply three the number people Russia then will save this amount plastics and for serious adult people who take decisions that would much more convenient (ah) much more let's say (erm) convincing yeah but was really interesting see how much effort you've made this work and that you have asked many people about their experience but maybe one question you think (um) how easily your experience could generalised all the people? for example now you're still school but maybe (ah) mommies and daddies with three four children who are running late from their work (ah) would care less about buying something plastic they would just have time going even (ah) very nearby market what can make about people having (ah) that are running out time 
 need say that mom was like these parents like you said she (um) always buy food supermarkets because is more convenient her she cant go local shops but when start this research work I share ideas with her and step step make made the little decisions like she put her now. food like vegetables and fruits eco box doesn't took time put not plastic bag but eco bag but also refuse plastic our home she also stopped using plastic bottles stopped using the straws for drinks home (um) adopting zero waste lifestyle and it's not about always about some difficult decisions and some (uh) ... more time spending it I think every person can little that's why put this quote my slide screen don't need the one hundred people doing perfectly because every person can little and will excellent for the whole world
so thank you much yes well differently zero waste programme very effective solution because should start doing something from ourselves good and effective solution. trying be more maybe environmental (erm) environment conscious right and well lifestyles that can changed yes that perfect way go out the situation are currently facing but still what you think? well your view well. can say that there should have been more government campaigns? well about doing something about trying initiate the zero waste program governmental level
yes (ah) a lot off (erm) activists zero waste movement from foreign countries they came with their decisions different solutions the government and really helps the local places like the city maybe the region (um) but our country is kind difficult do that but more and more people joined this movement will easily and will easily view this problem and view people who joined this movement and yes I think started ourselves but then when the there are there will lot people joined this movement will on government level
and what extent you think education institutions such schools lyceum gymnasiums well being involved into the same movement
oh think school is rather helpful maybe teacher children. about ecological situation about ways how they can make their lifestyle more environmental friendly what can done them help our planet to. solve some problems and there kind it the course biology but don't think is enough would like be more information about maybe not more information about problems more information about the solution these problems 
 well have understood that the main problems zero waste movement that some people are not aware it and some people are not able afford this type lifestyle and would like ask about her suggestions how solve these problems 
 have said the main for the main part this movement to tell people more and more about this movement about the solutions environmental problems (er) can told school maybe such places like conferences and think people think that they couldn't refuse their habits move with the zero movement why? because they don't know what they can they don't know that is really simple decisions really simple steps they can and they think is too difficult for them but that's only because they are not enough aware it.
