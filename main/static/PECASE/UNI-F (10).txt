(erm) would like tell you about the specific features (er) information perception preschoolers (erm) ... today child education has huge influence society (erm) well all parents want their children be smart but not all them (erm) not all them (erm) wonder what way their children (er) get information better (er) American psychologist Barbara Albras Heal and Lauren Broadway discovered that visual memory dominated auditory skills (er) they described this research how maximize child child's child's learning ability (er) thinking about (erm) perception information kilts they made the conclusion that there are three types children (er) the first type who perceive information visually (er) the second type who prefer using the auditory skill and the third type (er) keep (er) kinesthetics (erm) ... the psychologist shows that the first type dominated the modern world (er) however there are only little percentage preschoolers (erm) hope receive information through their ears and even fewer children who can called versatile (er) surprisingly but exact figures were given this research that's why decided (er) carry out my own study (er) find out them ratio (er) between (erm) between different ways how preschoolers perceive information (er) this investigation use not only auditory and visual methods (er) such cartoon and fairytale (er) but also combination these methods (er) using (erm) subjects presentation new new way perceive information ... sorry (er) choosing the topic feel like that should necessarily for society and preschoolers (erm) I've chosen the theme how they can save environment because today lots people (erm) the world forget that obviously should not pollute our planet have talk children about (er) about how people must behave not save and protect planet (er) I've divided children into three groups four persons each two showed (erm) cartoon called long live nature the first green group (erm) I've told fairy tale the second blue group and (er) showed the (er) subject presentation (er) probably which called (er) which which called public and save environment the third group third red group all methods presenting information (er) included the same content (er) after that I've done (er) individual questionnaire with every child that's them butter that presents (erm) (erm) the results my research for question are shown around the axis (erm) OX and the number children who answered correctly shown along the axis OY sorry (er) can seen according the bar chart (erm) forty six (er) and eight per cent (er) off (er) answers (er) were given children who watched their cartoon (erm) thirty four point two per cent (er) answers were given children who (erm) ... who who listened the fairytale and only twenty nine per cent (erm) these are the answers (erm) kids who watched and listened the subject presentation (er) having done this project and (er) the kindergarten for preschoolers are five years old (erm) having received and worked with the data proved the idea that visual (er) that visual memory dominated (erm) but was unexpected (er) that the presentation was (er) the least effective method perceiving perceiving information. children remember the fairy tale better I guess it's happened because (er) most parents fairy tales their children before they to bed and children are more used perceive (er) information through this channel moreover the presentation (er) quite hard for (erm) it's quite hard understand for preschoolers because (erm) it's not usual thing like cartoon and fairytale for them (er) so that's the probable reason why the presentation lost (er) conclusion wanted say that this project was challenging for (erm) but anyway (er) I'd like take part researches like this (er) for example would like make research between students and pupils (erm) compare the results (er) thank you for your attention I'm ready answer your questions
