 we'll start with report (er) representing cultural memory contemporary english model it was once said that was much for memory kids that is little bit left but how indeed memory topic that integrates disparate elements like other however memories not count any single discipline instead sociality philosophy history archaeology and religious studies are all involved exploring the connection between culture and memory and today want present you research.. work and the aim this work to reveal the cultural background the first world where make emphasis the characters their participation the world their emotions sufferings and traumas left after the World War . and literature this group would put forward several tasks the first step to reveal the main approaches memory studies and then the next step to read the book and analyze in terms cultural memory and the last but the most crucial step to reveal the cultural memory context this book the object and the subject are depicted this slide methodology this work based the theories different researchers this are the Osnos who does crack cultural memory concept which comprises the body cultural memory (er) which comprises the body social rituals (mm) different other things specific society each book this also the theory Maurice Kovács who was the first one give the phenomenon cultural memory name and proposed concept which concepts which comprise which (mm) recognized culturally collective nature cultural memory this also the point view given Pierre Neyron the shift (er) the focus his attention shifts the so-called sites memory which can geographical locations monuments buildings and what not and the most but not the least very taken under analysis by Oster Berl who would process cultural memory an umbrella term under which there number cultural social biological and cognitive phenomena and unlike all others describes she sets literature alongside with other civil force she gives semiotic model cultural cultural memory and now want tell you about this detail the first key element this model the dimension and there are referred different dimensions the first one represented different objects from the real life these can photographs symbols and other different objects social dimension can exposed through this mnemonic practices and when carries memory which can people social institutions and the mental dimension can exposed introduced can introduced through the remembered activity and the symbolic mediation the next key element this model the level this clear that there no collective memory that individual actualization and Oster Berl distinguishes two different levels the first one concerned with biological memory an individual whereas the second one refers the simbol the media the institutions and the practices which social groups construct their shared post and this clear that here memories used metaphorically because societies did not remember literally course and the last the about the most is also clear that there are different amounts remembering the identical post events and the book Oster Berl gives example remembering the word here you can see different modes. and course and course this list can continued and now want show you the most vivid examples from the book Birdsong here the material and social damage what mean I mean models and this are the objects given and course they remind about soldier fighting the world for the social dimension here can see the talk Irene Eric and and definitely they are the actors this and this dialogue and therefore. think this definitely the social damage the next example about the mental dimension and here can see also the remember activity Elizabeth and. here this an example her symbolic mediation the next example given about the levels cultural memory here see that both levels can not separate because theory they are separate but the real life they cannot because .you know while Roitman water Elizabeth jeanius and Elizabet remembering her own past and she's also constantly addressing their child for life with her sister and therefore can see both the collective memory collective memory and individual memory.. here you see example different modes go cultural memory which have found out our book and course said before this list can continued in this article closures that have come so you have seen the present borders with the past constantly because every time encountering something from the present pushes to think about the the past .and cultural memory you have seen unites not only people different generations but also different states and therefore can talk about the common shared past the humanity and cultural memory also is indispensable without all three dimensions. as you have understood are close reconnect with our past and this the idea that's supposed folks keen before writing the book Birdsong thank you for listening 
 .. you mind we ask some questions course you can I curious about couple things (er) but (er) the participants (er) the guests are also welcomed ask questions so how should define culture memory I myself went tailoring got into the yeah well for as somebody who not working with the boundaries this tradition that's not very familiar term right (er). if you could just couple words explain what this colocation means cultural memory right (er) hopefully I've said before Oster Berl difference cultural memory an umbrella term under which there number cultural social biological and social phenomenф and unlike all other she's talking about thуыу different dimensions and (mm).. definitely agree with her because you know cannot imagine cultural memory something something (mm)... something don't know what say this phenomenon which have different which has different peculiarities both the biological social and all others and this the phenomenon which cannot (er). looked from one point view right well how you put this thing cultural memory relationship something that's more familiar us let's say the regular private memory that have memory events my life what way it parallel the cultural memory because this this idea cultural memories this phenomenon фcross dimension it's the rather hard for to grasp that they want find his (er) footing now how it related just memory you know cultural memory think this like heritage the generation any state and can tell you about this detail sort put into some theories for example you we're talking about here the right is trying is talking about cultural memories heritage one state Francefor example we are talking about books for example cultural memory something the heritage the generation particular (mm).. and think that cultural memory something that unites both the collected and individual memory alright (er) thank you 
 you have any questions here ask them again (er) I'm interested your conclusive thesis about past bordering the present (er) you have hand any textual example from this thesis .can you exemplify that with something that you have the slides ... maybe you can give example just out the novel here you see this one yeah for example the and this are the objects for example from from the present and see but course connects with the past with previous with previous period time the for example and that's why think that constantly borders with with the past and present thank you great got and (er) one more thing when we're speaking about three that dimensions cultural memory for this text can identify most predominant one (mm)... think can talk about material dimension because now the book tells about the Diary Soldier and the main character finds and trying find out about the word because it (mhm) (er) what what what what what you mean that for example occurrences cultural memory the novel are mostly given material objects you're right (er) feelings lot's person mental some social (er) institutions organizations yeah think that yep because preliminary can see the objects first all which can remind about or (uhu) wouldn't mean that materiality again the main theme don't know idea the whole novel such so is the novel mostly about material objects is is is and why mean can you prove it's because you know .. because it the novels about love and family relations and broken hearts (er). these are not material things yep you're right but you know before writing the book was the main idea Sebstian Fox tell about the word itself and therefore thinking brooding over how how figure out how do the main idea was put different objects the first World War into the book show them and make them amenity it's not well I'm sorry I'm not familiar with the novel (er) could you give some idea of the plot the novel the advance the novel take place the time the First World War does the novel maybe depict characters who are engaged remembering First World War wh= wha= what it the novel divided into some parts and then some the main characters course are fighting the war and you see that war under how say under under ... this the war that tunnelers can and next the next part novel can say that another main character finds diary soldier and she's trying find out about so both the actions the war and the depiction cultural memory the present it right (em) are there any there part the novel that deals with the contemporary time does right and those characters who find the diary they are characters who supposed be living the present time yeah all right yeah (er) when these characters read the novel the diary I'm sorry the diary it's not really about re= remembering something because it's not part their experience it's about them maybe (er) some the would still classify memory because those people were living the present maybe they can't possibly have memory the first world war now guess you haven't got because they constant touch by for example (mm) their family the objects that they have the trunks something like that yeah terms cultural memory they share they share and that problem question about the difference between individual culture the culture the cultural cultural would thank you
