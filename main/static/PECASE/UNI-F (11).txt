okay good evening I'm and topic my presentation social roles curse blessing and want start presentation describing situation that occurred (um) when was school with friend she crossed the line subordination during the lesson joking her teacher led embarrassment and seems quite interesting me that such situations occur every time mix our social roles and here see the disagreement her two social roles the one that she played for her classmates she an amusing attractive person with whom it's interesting communicate and the one for her teacher (uh) she diligent student who interested the progress her education she's always polite and smart she has had acted student not like main during that very lesson this situation wouldn't have been confusing for everyone and our life full such social roles it's impossible live society without them also cannot get rid the social roles all they are the basis our communication a social role for is like list characteristics co=characteristics person should have one and another situation and the fact that use social roles does mean that realize their existence and reflect it can even have idea about what is and how can rate the usage one and other social roles that's why conducted the research order prove that social roles are essential understand the correlation between the age person and the number hours or she spends the social roles and analyze the impact the number the social roles the sort happiness person and first all should understand the meaning phra= term phrase social roles (uh) the slide you can see definition that found the dictionary social role the characteristic expected social function personal thing especially particular situation environment (uh) this term was put forward 1930 two independent each other American sociologists Lauf Clinton and George Habit Meet they defined and understood its meaning differently Lauf Clinton consi= considered as the unit the social structure expressed the system the norms that given person while George Habit Meet described as role play which person puts himself herself shoes another one and then assimilates and adapts therefore this process adaptation forms social part the personality during this process also learn see ourselves through the eyes others far my research concerned conducted survey the form questionary that that you can see your handouts and then collected raw data constructed graph and find correlation coefficients the results my work showed that people age from eighteen thirty one spend much more time their social roles than people other age groups means that the number social roles that have increases from the beginning our life then stays practically the same and the ends decreases results prove the opinion Robert Merton the children and (um) seriously ill people have few roles fewer roles comparison with adults who usually have many them (um) moreover found that people with large number social levels feel exhausted the end the day comparison with other age groups that's why can assume that our social roles require continuous attention and endless supports sustain them properly and the proper community person here one question appears appeared my mind it's difficult for to play our roles not confuse them then why we need them and the answer following social roles like the model social role like the model the idea behavior from society's point view all the roles were made for one purpose make the existence our society possible and comfortable for each individual social roles give the opportunity implement the features our character our social life and every role that have can help to realize our inner traits that have idea about social roles tell what do and are free choose how do this can this professionally and effectively we can look false and unnatural however the flip side that sometimes are tired our social roles and the reason this can limited capacity our memory our mind its biological structure just doesn't imply the process endlesh endless unconscious thinking and reflection the social roles (um) and you remember girl from the beginning my presentation the one that confused her social roles I hope you remember and now can confess that was I have set various roles for every person it's not big surprise that confused them mind stopped thinking and gave random model behavior (um) roles helped to become who want be pretended that I'm better than to hide real face protect nevertheless order avoid bad consequences (uh) shouldn't fall into contradictions between the social roles that have should try unify them and the best thing that can help in unifying social roles number principles speaking about about personal situation I can say that the lack the principles led to the point where started confuse social roles nevertheless still consider social roles blessing and they bring more merits than demerits my opinion
I just can't anything
and what you
I'm sorry
it's okay
it's the time actually
I know the last sentence and what your personal think are social roles curse blessing that's all
so can you answer the question are social roles curse blessing
I expressed
you mean like legal answer real one legally I'm obliged say they're blessing
but reality
but reality don't know a actually got some questions about (uh) how
methodology
how did you crunch the numbers basically you presented the table and the table and
it's part table
yeah yeah
in the description you can see
wha= what are the quality and satisfaction are they already arranged or
oh okay actually it's huge research (uh) for this research had get acquainted with some basic rules (um) making questionaries and here used some skills (um) for people choose mark mark and used in particular used seven degree seventh q
seven scales
yeah seven scales
so what were the scales age hours quality satisfaction
and also had my survey there were additional questions for people to relax understand the problem and some questions were (um) just empty not real not useful for because know some basic rules I've already mentioned and wanted get real data (um) and help people express their real (um) dumb ideas thoughts yes
can you please explain the graph it's all dark here so
I understand sorry for that actually you can see (um) the graph illustrates the dependence (um) little description (um) between
can you show on the slide
again okay I'm sorry I just closed the presenta= yeah
so lower better
I thought it's like cool oops (mhm)
yeah just little bit
it doesn't include controls
I see too dark
how was discovered
people and their
and this like the portion you came with
(mhm) and then this function we'll have disfunction pond correlation coefficients and the correlation very strong also made more graphs (uh) with more dependencies (uh) for example (uh) wanted connect I wanted connect results with some other extrapolate results for example with some suicidal specific and I'm sorry
so all everything was used it's you just you showed the graph with only two scales and you talk about the seven distance
so did did you think that there's some kind correlation not only between the age person and the number social roles that has play but (um) between the profession
professional groups of
yes professional groups once again the number social roles
educational level
(um)I think that (um) there definitely there correlation between the profession and the number the their social roles because for example you have higher education (uh) you work for example company big company you for example you can head this company and where you have more responsibilities you have more people under your span control you you have meet other new people and compare and this can compared with person (uh) with just basic education general I don't know compulsory yes (um) education doesn't (um) this person think has less (um) people communicate has less social roles because
and what about satisfaction
oh the satisfaction levels I think that personal opinion that you know more it's worse for you you think more you know more you think more you reflecting and you'd get it gets you trouble maybe some times and you were just know nothing know not much you are satisfied you are happy
less knowing worse thinking
 
less knowing worse thinking
it's like you know the opinion that silly girls are the happiest people because they don't understand the world how works
I think have question about the presentation about your presentation you have mentioned that (uh) that the term social roles (um) introduced two psychologists but caveman understood that many men don't really mind but (uh) which these points view appeals you more
okay thank you for your question (uh) think that the opinion George Habit Meet appeals more because firstly it's easier understand it's not like (uh) Ralph Clinton's the number characteristics one should have it's not understandable for but George Habit Meets opinion that you put yourself shoes another one like more understandable and more don't know real and have can imagine make some examples for example examples illustrating the idea George Habit Meet
and what the average number social roles that have pay play with for example or something thirty thirty something
one second
I'm forty how many how many social roles
based my graph I'm trying find it
I can see the correlation between the age the number hours not the number social roles
ah social roles
teacher wife mum friend neighbor
I cannot unfortunately cannot give you like number that okay you have them like forty roles
okay not not not not but average
um think that should (um) one second shouldn't (um) think this way shouldn't (um) estimate the numbers the social roles should estimate the hours my opinion because the number like too it's like specific case isn't specific case and should estimate the hours because you teacher the whole day
yeah but why (um) just can't understand think the most difficult thing when you switch from one role another but you then have play only like couple roles day and then not test for you
is for you (um) you already said you are like forty and for you it's okay you have not many roles like for example I have more roles because I'm the top this curve
because you're young girl
and it's already said it's hard for sometimes confuse them
do you think that that case it too many questions
it's okay
do you think that someone can like sort provoke you to to
to have another one create role
yes cross the line and play another role (uh) 
I think yes it's possible for example community you know school in the university now there term like peer pressure (um) they can influence you lot (um) for example my case choose (um) be closer them (uh) because joke was working my teacher and there case there chance case when teacher provokes student do some not really good things not your case not your case
and probably the teacher (um) sort got confused with his her role well and that yes that was what provoked you become another person deploy another role ... any other questions ... okay now thank you very much thanks everybody
