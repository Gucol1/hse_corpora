 good morning good afternoon name I'm student the 10th grade (um) is know that increase the consumption fruits vegetables and berries has positive effect the state cardiovascular system which manifested decreasing the risk the cancer stroke and other diseases close attention payed this way the which show have antioxidant and implementary properities are water-soluble plant pigment which give colour various fruits vegetables and flowers this compounds provide variety colours and create plans and prevent damage the photosynthesis apparatus the plant cell from excessive solar radiation recent years the attention researchers has been attracted the polyphenols wild dark-coloured berries where there are lot the forest and therefore wild berries the study where grown territory the republic relevant, especially the current etymological situation the purpose all work to quantify the content the polyphenol berries grown the territory the republic Karelia you can see the objectives the slide our research used spectophotonic analyses determine the total amount what spectrophotometry. is method measuring how much chemical substance absorbs light evaluting the intensity light beam light passes through sample solution took five samples berries collected the territory the republic Karelia red currant two samples lingonberries correct different regions the republic two samples cranberries. one which was frozen okay. our research use spectrophotonic analyses determine the total amount what spectrophotometry it's the method measuring how much chemical substance absorbs light evaluting the intensity light beam light passes through sample solution took five samples berries collected the territory the republic Karelia red current two samples off lingonberries one (um) which was collected different regions off the Republic two samples cranberries one which was frozen previously ground the berries through sieve later fifteen gram samples were taken they were placed glass cups and twenty milliliters alcoholic mixture were added the extraction was carried out for thirty minutes with Burdick steering after the extraction the extracts war filtered through paper filter then they were examined spectophotometry three measurements were performed for each extract from the obtained data can see that the highest concentration anthocyanins in frozen cranberries sample the smallest red currant berries two samples lingonberries collected different regions the Republic showed slight difference the content anthocyanins the composition geologically active substance and the level the accumulation depend the soil climatic conditions growth the growing season which was shown our experiment cranberry samples showed significant difference the content anthocyanins with their predominance biological active compounds sample frozen berries these difference the polyphenol content can explained the concentration biological active substance during freezing due moisture loss the lowest consideration anthocyanins was noted the berries red currant which consistent with the fact that their content anthocyanins in direct ratio intensity the colour the berries our hypotesis are partially confirmed the contents polyphenols dark coloured virus higher than slightly coloured ones the assumption that the content polyphenol berries the same species but collected different regions Karelia was confirmed. refuted the assumption that frozen berries will contain less polyphenols you can see the list information sources the slide. thank you very much for your attention 

 thank you (um) may ask you how happens that you have come with such topic what made you interest interested about berries 

 yeah thank you for the question I think is long story but will tell you just few years ago was writing with some list my ides the future and this year found and one the things was why berries and fruits are healthy I was like it great theme for research and asked uh teacher can this work? and she was really happy that found this theme 
 thank you and (um) one more question (uh) if berries are healthy like (uh) pills and drugs (uh) are there any side effects? (uh) may eat only cranberries (uh) my breakfast lunch and dinner and (um) are they (uh) well balanced terms other substances
oh course not I'm going continue work the future but now can say that all berries fruits are very healthy for you and (uh) the only difference in the how many other vitamins are these berries fruits and (erm) it's not really important you would eat like ten grams lingoberries you can eat twenty five grams uh maybe you (uh) cranberries like other strawberries and will okay
okay thank you much well can you please we're gonna move the previous slide slide number six well and maybe question will about the data set research data set far can see you have chosen analyze ling=lingonberries well that lingonberry from two districts but all other well samples and berries from well not district that would like identify maybe that the first question you and one more question why? and did you decide analyze sample frozen cranberries? what the idea underlying the choice?
(um) okay thank you for question because is was autumn and (um) berries are like had only these berries our fridges and (uh) like this (um) teacher had berriers from District and have lingonberries from District and they were (uh) different like district there was big berries like really big and District they were really small and was interested how that maybe (um) some difference between them and about frozen cranberries we had only one cranberry samples and would like think we will frozen will maybe healthier not because mom said every time like you should eat fresh strawberries fresh berries it's more healthier than frozen ones and (uh) confirmed this refuted this statement
what was the most difficult part your research?
 thank you for question I think that the most difficult part our work was (um) make all these experiments lab because was very long time
