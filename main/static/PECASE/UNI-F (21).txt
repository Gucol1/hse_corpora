the 1930s Nowadays woman woman are changes now social ruoles change now the modern world it very important now know how was then and why this process happening again thank you very much any questions I have two questions first you write the word business what does mean business the socialist society because the word business the word world here meant some activity the husband not business like the capitalistical (other sounds) of course not Like money and the woman who makes money the equal situation makes money (russian speech) means that earn (russian speech) (Mgm) means that she earns living she can it herself it's the language but very important question what the difference between feminization and emancipation. the difference between these words the context the feminization the state means that more women could leave the country and emancipation is the usage female labour because the western world feminization and emancipation have many common senses in the soviet Union the situation was different yes course any other questions. thank you very much for your presentation
