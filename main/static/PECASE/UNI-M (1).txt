okay (er) today I'd like call to talk about casuals when they get into our games they're really getting our nerves that one guy who just doesn't want cooperate well actually we'll won't talk about people we'll talk about the games (er) hyper casual games not not (er) specific genre it's subtype it's connects with how difficult game is but with the most (er) tough describe things there no one particular description but the one I'd like (er) ... some modern times (er) the one I'd like use (er) it's type game that can described touch play very simplistic design and (er) the rules it not very hard some the examples them you you know them you really did play on all them but it's just you never use the hyper casual term (er) one (er) and one the (er) most (er) famous perhaps the one that started the big boom that (er) this medium seeing right now (er) yeah Flappy Bird there the one game (er) but don't just take word that (er) this industry booming right now (er) (er) look some wait what that's the wrong presentation we'll manage ... (er) don't take word (er) take (er) look the numbers right now (er) the whole gaming market the mobile market (er) takes (er) around per cent overall games market the hyper casual subpart it one the most prevalent the market itself taking astonishing one hundred thirty seven billion dollars and (er) it's actually one the fastest grown (er) seasoned fastest growth all them you're still not satisfied with (er) with the numbers let's see what (er) ... (er) Misha Kolotkov has say (er) the Rovio's head designer casual games implement deeper meat core features they become more engaging but also more complicated this turn opens segment hyper casual games that dominate games that are easy start and fun play (er) and (er) we (er) you were open (er) the app store page just year ago you would only see around three games top fifteen but right now the picture complete opposite only three them will not hyper casual games and (er) some analysts say that twenty twentyone will the most dominant market (er) right now think that consoles games they're the dominant ones they're the ones what that play many will disagree many will say that the mobile the future the mobile what driving the market right now and (er) people (er) seeing that the triple scene also realizes that maybe they need change something about themselves and basically that was face when heard that cause right now (er) many developers what (er) many consider the real games like for example God War I'm gonna beat dead horse right right here bit Fortnight they're moving into the realm creating games not single player experience they're moving (er) into the realm making services that (er) they'll able implement micro-transactia sorry microtransactions and (er) sell not only core game existence but also some extras (er) and can see this with (er) some projects Elder Scrolls Blades (er) which (er) moving the usual the usual games from the realm PC and consoles onto the mobile it's not (er) that it's bad it's just with every day passing the idea that the triple scene going crash soon not (er) far away we can think because this really creates disconnect with the whole player base it's it's not about the strategies that they use it's about how they implement them and (er) don't want get into the controversy but even the developers like the Bethesda game studios well the last one fall with the failed projects and underperforming the past years the titans this industry cannot their work then who will save thank you for your attention
thank you ... any any questions aren't you interested games
yeah like elder scrolls I've not played don't know bit
okay
I'm real sorry actually used the draft version don't know what went wrong like apologize advance
 have participated global game Jam last year and tried create (er) this type game (er) we'd the market research like (er) looked top one hundred games the Google store but why (er) but (er) why (er) even get enough attention from (er) audience why you think
oh you mean why the sudden shift the attention or
like ... was (er) sorry
so maybe start talking and you'll restructure the question the boom (er) hyper casual games actually happened from (er) March two thousand seventeen the May two thousand eighteen that was (er) the samples that were taken were the app stores were actually taking off and it's it's it's not something particular it's just suddenly got onto people people actually realized that is lot more profitable spend week the home alone and create something well (er) don't want swear but subpar product basically it's not that hard code it's not that time consuming but (er) with the implementation (er) clever ads (er) it's makes (er) sometimes double the profits usual normal game that would take lot longer develop and lot more force used make it
so your research for developers not for users
(er) my research basically trying answer the question how how this hyper casual side (er) gaming (er) transferred into the realm triple how they changed (er) (er) on the wave this (er) new fluffy thing because right now we actually think about there's lot more games that are multiplayer and there are lot more games with single player experiences just (er) actual service where you have dump money into and only then you're allowed play spend your time freely
okay I don't
I need speak while doing the research about what you think the th= the want say again (er) the hyper casual games aren't sheepish customers than developed one hundred people
I don't get the question sorry

I still didn't get it
well then hyper casual game game that was made one person like that
yes is possibly basically yes yeah as the Flappy Bird was made one person again
do you think that the you think that they should cheaper
yes they are cheaper make 
do you think that (er) the price needs against the popularity that first people should play enough that play sit still it's doesn't difference lot gamers then you first play and after that you can buy the continue fee
yeah and here's the problem what many people don't like about this new approach making service and then you having pay extra for is that your (er) (er) let let's make small analogy it's like you're you're showing (er) cake person and you're saying look this pleasant cake but uh look this glass ceiling you have pay some extra remove so you can actually taste the cake you'll show (er) some small mechanics (er) the game loop but you won't (er) allow the game itself flourish and you'll charge extra for (er) the main problem it's it's okay free play games that but right now are (er) the year when (er) full forty dollars sixty dollars games that for example there was (er) think was met= Metal Gear Solid Five and actually hid the true ending the campaign behind paywall that's not very good do that's not very good practice they received real hard backlash from that 
what you think about the influence rewarding memory (er) game pay play
basically it's irrelevant (hehe) because (er) the (er) memory not problem any media right now we're point where (er) the the only place where memory does matter when you're programming CPU GPU goes that's the only place where you have hard limit that you only have the set amount assume commands before you run out them
ok thank you very much
thank you
