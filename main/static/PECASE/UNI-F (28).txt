our. last but not least speaker. who going talk. about. something. quite complicated from point view. the effect the carrageenan rats' I so have idea what means. but 
 would affect. your. (er) presentation. hope something
would be. what 
i hope would very successful
(mm) yes. is... good afternoon. dear colleagues.. name .. I'm student of. Chemistry and Biotechnology Department. from. Perm National. Research Polytechnic University.. today will you about my. scientific research.. the. effect carrageenan. on. rats' I T... let's talk talk about food additives.. the use food additives. is. widespread modern world.. food additives are positioned. harmless.. (er) while. their components. affect. the... affect the. physiological processes. particularly ones. for. like.. in. I T.. also. food additives may. affect (eh) influence. to.. instant.. microbiota. and. (mm) ... what want talk about today. is. carrageenan.. is used as. stabilizer and thickener.. you may find i=. found it. in. dairy products. products. jellies. (mm) maybe some confectionery.. researchers from. around the world. are still study the influence carrageenan on. mammals'. I T.. there are two major groups.. people who claim. the of carrageenan. and people who don't ... so.. despite disagreements. (eh) the=. there is. maximal concentration. carrageenan. in. products.. according to. World. Health. Organization. the maximal concentration one percent.. is. corresponds. with (eh) this corresponds Russian San Pin... have.. big group. twenty rats. determine. the influence their I T.. ten rats. from. experimental group. eat carrageenan in. concentration one percent. and. the other ten. not.. (eh) there are. five males and five females each group. that guarantees. that this microbiota. were evaluated from both group. both groups. since the. sixth November.. now. can see some. changes. both groups.. let's. start with blood parameters.. normalization that parameters. different ratios. analyzed by. component. blood count. and chemical analysis.. wait.. experimenta= (eh) males from experimental group.. lighter than. males from control group. and females from experimental group. are heavier than. females from control group.. and this microflora.. both groups (mhm) can see.. lactobacillus and different bacterium decreased.. different ratios. (mm) both groups.. the end the experi= experiment. will in March.. now. is difficult say anything certain about. danger carrageenan.. because. all the results. within normal rates.. thank you for your attention.. really happy to. answer your questions
my didn't. what carrageenan... what is
it food additive. stabilizer. thickener..
is natural not
it (er) people. is natural. you see. Red (er) Sea.
seaweeds
sea= seaweeds
and (er) like food industry are using it
yes
 funny 
 they use it. what's the point. for your research.. they before using this. food 
because there are different. facts about. (er) danger carrageenan
so they use but it's dangerous
they use in concentration one percent. that's why World Health Organization. (er) discuss. every five years. about. the.. danger it
uh. it's not good
it's not good peak concentrations.. and. the one percent. is. is ok.. but sometimes.. there are discussions
and another question. it enough to. speak about. ten. rats. only. doing experiment like that
(er) my experiment. twenty rats
n= one experimental. and one group. te= ten rats. they 
 control group and experimental group.. cause may take. more rats but it's expensive for student
speaking about. scientific result. it 
it ok. is enough. enough
it ok actually is depend the field. 
yes course. (eh) you may. use mini pigs. monkeys. humans.. but. first all. use rats
is there something new the 
what 
like this experiment
(er) think there are. yes there are different experiments. (eh) the people. study the. different concentrations... (mm) maybe one. fifty percents. and. but never see.. never see microflora. the experiments.. so. we. try to. study. how the microflora. microflora I will change. would change
my question would about statistics because know that people from natural science use statistics
yes
and far understand this work in progress and 
is progress yes
and you are you going use some statistics order establish significance between the experiment and the control groups and what kind coefficient you use
coefficient between rats and human
no coefficient between the control group and the experimental group order understand significance statistical significance you should count. well you should make test maybe. some other statistical tests. no
we have blood parameters right this microflora the March will make gastro= gastro analysis
ok. but how how are you going conclude about significance statistical significance the resluts
we have we have analyse datas
but you don't know how
no haven't got enough results because this intermediate results in the end can absolutely it
ok and I'm asking what yeah coefficient you use normally
like. what 
 say because don't it yet ok
because sociologists for example use normally tests for example. ANOVA analysis and something like this
we don't it yet because we haven't got enough
I'm actually asking about future about the future
in the future will much work
ok. any other questions.. so. thank you very much.. thank you all the presenters.. all the presentation were very different and very uni=
