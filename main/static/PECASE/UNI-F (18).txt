 next (er) report will by (speaker name) allogism feature Jonathan Safran Foer style the example short story here are quickly yes good afternoon dear colleagues have always been introduced name (speaker name) this year I'm graduating from our Perm State University and today would like show you some results my research work the topic alogism feature Jonathan Safran Foe style I've analyzed alogismand the example the short story so quickly on the whole way developmental linguistics form some various connections with other sciences (er) including logic which very close exact sciences Initially the antique time logic was based three subjects which were mathematics(er) philosophy and grammar and for Middle Ages linguists and philologists studied the problem language and mind and nowadays philo= philologists usually explore how some logical (er) categories are expressed means different languages among common terms being logic logic and linguistics there such term alogism. philosophy defines alogism illogical judgment which breaks the rules logic effects that can't explained with logic literary studies alogism seen stylistic mean which presupposes some violation logical rules some logical connections the text some variations alogism are seen are presented the slide which are logical break between phrases parts the dialogue
it could position objects and features that have nothing common destruction causal relations well meaningless arguments alogism and serves base for many stylistic devices and figures speech such oxymoron and others coming this kind research (er) this report aims present the results research alogism feature key feature Jonathan Safran Foists style. actually Jonathan Safran Foist contemporary American writer he's most renowned novels are everything illuminated and extremely loud and incredibly close although (er) pre last year I'm not mistaken published his last novel here .and according this story answered quickly was published New York 2010 it's composed similarly restructured sentences (er) which are not explicitly connected with each other each sentence characterizes one two main characters the short story and presents some (er) some their everyday lives and duties the short story like he's some kind it collage like ways gives an insight into man woman relationship way from the beginning marriage than having child getting old and last dying analyzed the story three levels concerning level ideas the deepest one then (er) the level images (er) which reflect some ideas expressed through the text and then come into the kind surface level verbal expressions (er) on the level ideas the deepest ones the short story has different had several contradictory ideas for example the first one you can see (er) that here that's life and marriage general not some polar thing can say that life totally good totally bad well marriages instead it's seen some collision and combination happy and unhappy moments knowledge and absence knowledge success and failure then can see some combination two opposite ideas which are that everything constantly changing there's the idea non-convertible changes (er) yes you can see the example here that changed and changed and with more time will change more and actually nothing you can with and the same time see some sentences which prove the idea that can't change anything like and here aren't quickly (er) everything else happens why the thing that could have .and the last but probably not least (er) there are some ideas actually empiricism presented the novel (er) I'll try prove (er) verbs and other the words which express feelings emotions some attachment senses they are more often given their formative forms like was some tired food you laughed reimposed hated our bed meanwhile those elements which characterized some cognitive processes thinking memory (er) often obtain negative connotation they are used the negative forms like was always hearing father's voice senses but never remembering his face you didn't know where were the what remember the more distant feel
so yes can suggest that the author the character (er) shares views empiricism they believe life cannot (er) perceived and understood means logic thinking cognitive processes general and also principles empiricism which include inductive way judgment you remember some philosophy it's way judgment but move from particular general some general conclusions and the short story is cause also can seen (er) the short stories made enumerating some facts some details lives character which are then kind generalized the last paragraph you're interested can can share with you later key ideas are expressed then images (er) some them include images home house which corresponds quite strongly with the main idea the of the short story also see some images Godyn which quite interesting and also reinnervation restoring house through these images (er) also conveys the ideas changes again and the ability change (er) some adaptation ideas probably (er) and there also compound metaphor which spans throughout the whole short story which metaphor life journey you see these quotations like why foreign cities came me much me have always never been here (er) the author main character probably thinks categorical way that's why most images are the form categories which are the most general versions because you then hear the left side the slide thus see images happiness knowledge success love which also have their opposites formed means negation (er) for love have hatred for them have immobility etc (er) then these are categorical character images are displayed language various ways (er) firstly multiple usage adverbs time such always never is the second kind line here the first absence logical connections you may look examples and understands (er) yeah the second about adverbs time like (er) always never usachev usage such pronouns everything and nothing you see it's not something (er) it's not today it's not tomorrow it's not two it's always and never also there author used quite often the adverb just which makes characters words sound bit like excuse was mostly just joking you were always awful estimating and on far also see some cases matching elements with opposite meanings here come too real alogisms the language we were always never mentioned it you tried only nothing there also actually loves these collocation always never very much uses for about or times the short story which quite quite short story then have position non opposites elements like was not afraid being let alone just hated and could emphasized some more phrases. then. (er) one laws logic especially the law identity violated come the language game (er) for instance was always almost always home but was not always home home so said nothing nothing here one more interesting example presented here but will read (er) wait second I'm sorry yeah you would not bring the sound but you are not content be not content they kept producing things that didn't need that needed you see this language game sometimes based the repetition the same words phrase some grammar (em) structure which then has some shift its meaning and have understand and dig deeper (er) and last again but not least example double negation should pay extra attention it with the help double negation the author combines some opposite categories again what was not unrealistic anymore not unthinking just reckless and negations these kind actualised semantics uncertainty ambiguity double meaningness which are also seen the level ideas. coming some conclusions can track that alogisms displayed all layers this short story and actually the whole (er) the whole kind style (character name) suffering for but here presented the one short story but could analyze whole variety his other literary works and alogisms serve sometimes the link connection which often absent the short story contrasting ideas combination opposites and denial rational thinking are then expressed these categorical images and then find some realization the language including double legations oxymorons and language game alogism seen stylistic mean and is often used express some sarcasm (er) humour well grotesque it used show some controversial ideas processes paradoxes (er) is quite to believe that here the short story the author actually tries (mm) again has emphasize this controversy the controversial processes probably and our case it's possible think that alogism at the same time the way author's thinking which done reflects the way (er) (mm) character speech and the same time it's kind linguistic representation these cognitive processes that's you're interested you can take look reference list and which some some works which were used and I'm happy answer questions maybe will first ask other people ask questions not do you have any questions cause maybe you you mentioned that (er) one short story talks about relationships between men and women would you say that alogism an aspect them relationships you mean real life In how this alogism relate the explanation relationships between the men and women well probably haven't stated this particular this connection with relationships (er) but maybe because they there seeing some controversy between characters like for example there was pot when when the child was born and there was paragraph consisted almost all sentences beginning with laughed hated and you laughed and you hated and there was really seen some contradiction between what the main character which loves and hates and which what thinks his wife should what the short story was you loves and hates yeah would probably think about this thing just clarify when you say that the not the story consists similar sentences what you mean similar mean that they're not course all similar but (er) quite often see parallelism syntactic parallelism we suppose yes they almost all begin with the subject then verb and object and on (mhm) thank you (em) got you correctly you said that the rate the things categories probably which kind mean how how much it close what you're supposed to alogism can be one the statements that when you say something similar this yes thank you cause seems me contradict the thesis about the rate be immersed the sensual world (mm) thinking categories that's abstract it's abstract yes and that's logic yes and this that's again the second other early alogism but that's not probably the story that's your evaluation the story that's true and then you have this contradiction the narrator can you explain anyway is is the text sential rational (em)...that's difficult (er) would say is more sensual than rational but still deals with some really big notions again like love like hatred there are some sentences like was enabled didn't know how all these kind (er) categories being able be unable loving hating (er) didn't know but they concerns mostly some census this again why maybe this kind contradiction and just probably last question from was trying be with the examples that you showed and kind didn't have the time full some agree and some disagree particularly can have look again your example double negation sure mean why you find this illogical which linguistics wh= sorry what (er) yes double negations yeah (er) because sorry (er) logic actually there ..some operation which negation and could (er) used (er) here's slightly negative applied negative storms yes but (er) here actually it's (mm) logic could you know some contrasted not not not it certain logic you know was not unrealistic was rather really realistic not about logic it's about the degree which goes beyond long was kinda rather rather realistic yes not ideological but but logical is kind it goes against the it doesn't against the logic follows the same logical rules but is not often seen language and is rather often English actually well yes typical English way expression just need you consider I'm done right wanted ask why you think all this what happened the story it's not just the paragraphs the story see how striking than usual is how striking then usual the language and you choose take look all that through this through the prism this notion alogism yeah but speaking about the big picture yeah how why the story written like this what does the author achieve manipulating the language well and according you the logic this extraordinary way my mind again yes because it's kind personal experience reading the story yes but was personal reading scholar believe that this this kind the aim the author was put question .to really question relationships question marriage question love because actually ends as ends with question and (mm) think just yes that actually to question everything show how how various everything could and how how quickly ends Because the kind the topic the headline (er) and here aren't quickly probably show some (mm) really quick pace life and some frag= that the world fragile Everything fragile and another one. this story written .well it's character narration right yes the first person narration do you think that the narrator believes that this way expression natural way expression does the narrator deliberately produce this speech which so bizarre from the point view our common language? (er) think (er).. does doesn't it deliberately doesn't have this aim (mm) don't know proving something making some (er) emphasis to change something that probably what thinks because yes have already mentioned there's not much connection between some connection between sentences he could move from (er) making toast the morning (er) driving car and mentioning some details about that probably are just kind (er) just his thoughts coming mind the narrator not doing deliberately then has tell as readers something about the narrator right how would how would characterize the narrator such speech what are supposed infer from he unconsciously uses that kind very idiosyncratic language yes probably he's man which which lost he's man that it's different that he's man because he's married with children that explains no they're they're different they're different man married with children probably he's very lost man and tries find again some answers analyzes his life his past experience it think the word lost would would say most do you know who is who the narrator we have only the narrator and cannot guess cannot yet doesn't have any name can guess that is because there was part which you which his wife has child we kind can know that man well things happen well this was 2010 probably then people couldn't have child from man thank you/
