good afternoon thanks for coming name and I'm software-engineering student. the title my research major principles customer friendly software development (er) the report address the issue creating user friendly software tools and designer the solutions for the establishment (mhm) convenient and user-friendly interaction (er) much famous software development companies are still popular due lack (er) the competitors (er) programmers who get used com= communicate with (er) their professional colleagues and not with users (er) sometimes (er) make (er) the most important decisions and has some negative consequences like (er) avoidance such programs products users and their attempts (er) find easier and more pleased work software (er) the main objective my research to allocate the main key features customer friendly software which make interaction process easier and achieve the objective several tasks are be solved (er) analyze literature the subject allocate (er) key aspects customer friendly software and prove importance allocated features (er) first I'd like give you bit background user-friendly (er) subjective term ... (er) nevertheless there are (er) several commonly agreed (er) features that make software user-friendly (er) color combinations preliminary settings grouping controls the basis usability and similarity and the other functionality I'd like start with color color influences (er) human's perception several ways determines perceived along time and (uh) readability two thousand and four (er) Glound Reaparty and others proved (er) that (er) light green (er) blue background colors are associated with shorter (er) perceived download time than standard yellow vivid red (er) according statistics which was constituted Ben Chelly two thousand businesses lose lot more than four billion dollars annually because visitors don't (er) don't wait (er) time consuming pages download and this problem may solved partially (er) with (er) competent color selection also (er) color combinations influence (er) readability (er) the research (er) the most used color combinations had been conducted Haul and Hannah two thousand and four (er) results show (er) class (er) that the most readable color combinations are classical black text white background and light blue text black background (er) both white and cyan text black background are less readable many professionals devoted (er) interaction development different articles and books and famous (er) American software designer and (er) programmer Alan Cooper no different wrote that absence pleminist= pleni= sorry preliminary settings (er) perceived inexperienced users serious (er) benefit software because allows (er) not waste time configure different program modules sometimes users haven't enough time desire (er) set (er) new program (er) it doesn't provide them opportunities (er) meet (er) least part their needs (er) they will find (er) better way get what they want like future (er) they will (mhm) devote their time (er) figure out how get more features but not many people want it the moment (er) Cooper marked that (er) program (er) grouping program controls the principle (er) similarity and usability helped reduce (er) search time necessary tools (er) sometimes when software companies start create (er) new program they don't focus main (er) users groups (er) is poor decision start develop new program without upfront planning developers want create for example (er) I'm sorry (heh) is (mhm) (er) sorry (er) let's consider the last version the program Microsoft word main tab contains lot useful options but how often users (er) use all them (er) (er) number equally useful tools are included other tabs (er) forces users (er) feel themselves humiliated and start and improve chance make (er) mistake and person who can't find necessary tool (er) become nervous and his desire use this program (er) goes into the thin air and finally the other important aspect according Cooper functionality should (er) meet users needs depending their requirements when software companies start (er) develop new program (er) the new program (er) (er) (er) they can (er) don't (er) can they don't focus main user groups (er) and (er) developers (er) start create for example (er) simple photo editor for casual use non-professional user and not for professional (er) experienced (er) designers photographers (er) is not good idea fit all existing tools this simple program (er) conversely it's recommended use the shortest possible compelling and really demanded (er) instruments range users will happier they won't need (er) waste their time master new program taking everything into account (er) the research (er) the result research (er) provides information about major principles customer friendly software development which should (er) covered developers and is correct color combinations (er) preliminary settings (er) shouldn't binding (er) and grouping controls the principle usability and similarity and functionality should (er) (mhm) (er) should meet users' requirements that's all thank you for attention (er) you have some questions (er) I'm ready answer
thank you 
there an idea that for some customers there no need use such like very complex tools (er) and methods programs we just need some buttons with some functions and what can you (um) ... what can you offers such programs basic programs
(er) Alan Couper's book (er) (er) solution for this program (heh) problem I'm sorry (er) (er) 
 for example think maybe the color is good point because for example paint saw kite 
I'm sorry don't understand your question correct
program (um) and the design some programs Windows not great my opinion (er) maybe they can use like more cus= cus= colorized colors for example red
 (er) know Microsoft has (er) some gui= style guides and (mhm) simple users can't (er) change (er) (er) interfaces (mhm) but you want create program without Microsoft and other companies (er) you can provide users (er) some tools set interface
 uh-huh can that yes 
yes
 can you try analyze user interface (er) web applications Internet project for example Internet so= social networks (mhm) not only table not only Office software
(mhm) may used (er) also web interfaces is (er) unique principles (er) both desktop (er) applications and for web (mhm)
so you mean your principles are sort universal
(mhm) (mhm) (heh) yes it's universal
I was just checking whether got you right
can you list the examples (er) bad luck projects bad luck (er) web applications your opinion
 (hmm) for example Microsoft Word (heh) also offe=
no product (um) industrial project internet project
 (mhm) can't remember right now 
our university portal LMS ... what about LMS
I think it's (er) may better students who created will (er) (mhm) more (er)
not functionality but (er) user interface 
sometimes (er) they are hard (er) found find necessary tools and (er) often (er) click some buttons links (er) find what need and (er) think that is waste time may better
ok thank you
 question
yes have question you touched subject creating like two kind interfaces for usual users for professionals you think is necessary have some kind variant where you could able alternate between the two views one program
(mhm) some companies (er) use this (er) method (er) they have (er) interface for casual users for professionals (er) and sometimes you should pay for getting more (er) functions (er)which may (er) showing interface
do you have any examples such programs
(mhm) ... (mhm)
I can give you example for example you did mention not the current version but like two years ago which should buy which provided with customizable interface
