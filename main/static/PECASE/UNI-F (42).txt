(er) good afternoon. ladies and gentlemens. would like present you research I've got presentation think (er) the other hand will good enough for because will have not any technical problems with (er) our presentations let just speak from heart ... okay name and student the Orenburg State University the Faculty the Foreign Philology and would like present you research the topic (er) the Lewis an Educational Novel (er) this novel British author Clive Staples Lewis has become one the most favorite books for both children and adults (er) around the world since its release nineteen fifty.. (er) the plot combines many motives from Christian course ... .. Mythological the hypothesis our studies .. our study sorry that this works belong the gender educational novel and the aim the research to analyze canonical pictures (er) the novel and do this will course outline the specificity the genres and examine its characteristic features identify them the work and the study (er) according the Bakhtin (er) the novel the only emerging and not yet established genre moreover at this moment are all witnessing its formation because the basic criteria the genre study are still not fixed having all sorts variation and (er) their manifestations sorry thus all varieties the novel are continuous formation the educational novel itself has rather deep roots since goes back the most ancient initiation stories with cultural social and historical background and also forms the basis epics and fairy tales nations from all over the world also Bakhtin his scientific study comes the conclusion that many scholars erroneously classify works belonging the shader basing only the compositional features significantly narrowing the criterion entrance (er) novels into this category.. (er) some them the contrary significantly expanded arguing that any works which the moment the development and formation hero traced can considered educational novel and for Bakhtin becomes obvious that first all all the work should highlight the moment essential formatio man determining that the change hero acquires platforming significance ... (em) the 20th century is characterized global transformation the literature (er) that emerged against the backdrop social cultural and geopolitical events the world (er) genres also undergo changes and educational novel for the authors an attempt understand the place man the new changing world (er) the theme the inner struggle the psychological and social formation hero comes the forefront also Bakhtin offers classification an educational novels distinguishing above five types and for our study the most important the last one the main difference which the formation the hero not connected with passage time but the contrary against the background static and already made world (er) the novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe the main characters face difficulties that they have overcome (er) these events have significant impact their characters and create their personalities accidentally find themselves magical world called Narnia and the country in despair with power concentrated the hands the white witch because whom on winter rains the legend says that two sons Adam and two daughters Eve will defeat the and bring spring back the inhabitants Nania (er) the heroes are forced circumstance so the slap the tongue just such long day circumstances sure set the challenge and the part the family course rails solve the problem but Edmond because his pride and vanity some way turns out be traitor and helps Chaddies who flatters the boy bring his sister and brother her course because just kill them (er) son Adam (em) should much like see your brother and your two sisters will you bring them me I'll try say Edmond still looking the empty box it was the empty box from the rahatlukun that she gave him ... the textbook (er) devoted the study the educational novel the literary process the 19th century identifies number features the classic educational novels.. (er) autobiography a similar origin story learning wandering conflict and some other and the novel itself (er) course can say it's autobiographical (er) Clive Staples Lewis was drafted into the British Army junior officer the age nineteen and as result the bombing London the children find themselves sent far away from the war from the warm to the home lonely professor that family friend Edmond, Peter and Lucy also Susan (er) were left their own and the youngest ones are unwilling submit the eldest and eventually intractable family conflict develops that cannot resolved without adult help and they have none. (er) the heroes through training when Aslan the true King Nania who brings freedom and spring the country tells Peter the rules battle for further participation the war (er) gave Peter plenty advice on how .. conduct facilities and addition also our heroes through trials such first all. Edmunds betrayal but where the he has tried betray them and join the Wild Witch Peter result all events has learn (er) how .. wield weapons and even kill which suddenly affects the inner world the hero the novel it seems the boys that everything around him was only blood and wolf hair and moment later the monster lay dead his feet ... course Lucy and Susan also faced the horrors war and they have took part it and for sake freeing people Nania from the White Witch rule as result our study found that Clive Staples Lewis novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has the following features an educational novel (er) such firstly the narrative devoted the hero and host changing have platforming significant significance sorry secondly the novel partly autobiographal autobiographical this English language thirdly the lack spiritual clothing with the parents and teaching the characters the art war besides internal conflict experienced Edmont who betrays the family but eventually comes the second conclusion reuniting with the family thus the hypothesis the study proved and the work have analyzed can truly recognized an educational novel thank you for your attention I just ready listen to your question and answer 
 Right after that I got question just comment I think in these forums (em) when you have the opportunity put like maybe visual physical presentation just makes the research flow little better and easier follow it's very apparent that your English was fantastic. was able understand (em) your speech but think the future when you have the opportunity absolutely should jump it 
 sure course ... thank you for the advice 
 Thanks I have couple things clarify for myself when you say educational novel you mean what Bakhtin calls buildings 
 sure course comes be like German history and the literature and on 
 then understand you right (em) can you give an example . kind .. (er) earlier maybe prototypical novel of this genre but that which at the same time closest to Lewis's novel ... kind parallel 
 yes can and just talking about.. like the very beginning that some the explorer just made ..(er) little bit extended narrowing these (er) novels yes something connected with the course and (er) just can`t remember clearly the name but course it's just there are several educational novels that can say at the 
 yes what mean that that comes first when you're talking about the genre but (er) that seems be rather far away from Lewis in terms the development the plot and the image the central character ... (er) that's what was asking this question what closest this genre 
 said the very beginning the genre novels like Bakhtin said that the genre now just developing and it's always its like. moving and development just constant I think can (em) find some examples like the criterion such novel and course something that connectly close the children and on it's just may call educational novel I think and found some criterion that just appropriate for such work such novel 
 okay and just one more question for .. when you. make conclusion about proving your hypothesis (er) and you say that this novel belongs the genre educational novel you insist the presence single genre that you deny the multigenre nature this novel 
 course is multi general because first all is like fantasy (er) course and yes is like multi general novel because we can see lot different like say items that author put his novel his work and can also say that is course fantasy and educational novel 
 then you claim that educational component educational genre component the dominant one here ... for example for that almost the novel an allegory christian allegory why educational genre comes the forefront 
 I'm not sure that like (er) the main general that makes all the novel I think first all is course fantasy because was made for children for their (er) lie advertisements and on (er) somehow for them to interesting and course can say that (em) to the forefront can (er) just place the fantasy course and maybe the second on the third place it an educational novel 
 then that will probably my piece advice for you terms prospects your work yeah build not kind .. component of this model but build .. overall model genre this book which much more complicated 
 okay thank you will
yeah I had ... quick question as researcher as reader what you gain classifying this novel an educational novel 
 course (er) want think that is educational novel because it's just for children and ...(er) think first all (er) all know that Clive Staples Lewis .. truly Christianin and here put some educational context it for children just make maybe say the Bible more clear for children while they read because they've got some ... like ..items and course sorry I forgot the word ... (mmm) ... some persons from the Bible 
 all right
 any follow questions 
 not from 
 okay that was our last presentation this session
