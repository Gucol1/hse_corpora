so (er) first all everyone (erm) I'm (er) first year student (er) HSE faculty economy (er) like talk about the paradox consumption as know consumption has always been one the most intrinsic part economy (erm) like the whole economies founded it and the higher is the greater (er) becomes GDP since sixty percent the world's GDP consists consumption expenditures (erm) (er) yeah but.. undoubtably (er) consumption ..suggests lot measures for economy but does mean it that perfect it seems be (erm) this day and age (er) are living (er) consumption consumer society.. where people always tend how will all that luxury (erm) recently was mentioned (er) Wind Hein his happiness and nations (er) pointed out the optimal society (erm) well that people have been looking for (erm) searching for optimal society (er).. came across (er) consumer culture (er) (er) individuals nowadays (er) purchase and consume not order like satisfy their needs but first all and mostly they consume and buy product goods (er) be high social level (er) the notion being (er) high social status front everyone others eyes put perspective unfortunately may like (erm) anyway nowadays(er) like this all stuff product goods that were word mouth couple months ago (er) now may not that fashionable and considered (er) (er) out date (er) consequently (er) people are change the product goods great rate moreover being surrounded multifarious amount (er) commercials claiming that do not (erm) like correspond think change fashion (er) accelerate this process even (er) now people mean all are sick with (erm) are all sick with consumerism syndrome (er) consumerism the consumerism and all general creates high standards that even not everyone able reach but everyone strives for and that now not products are adapted (er) people's demand but either way around like people (er) demands are adapted product goods be like (er) again have high social level (er) (erm) like the whole lifecycle people mostly about consuming (er) but (er) the fact that we consume and trash too fast (er) like for example North America nine percent (er) consumer goods (er) are being trashed within six months after being purchased course (er) and this all course (er) results increase amount waste (er) due waste dispose rate too high (er) recycling processes (er) are not able handle (erm) consequently (er) waste (er) ends in land (er) landfill sites (er) and now (er) let's talk about (er) ecology (er) (er) it's not hard grasp that recently (er) given arguments are (er) are also resulting ecological problems (er) people always (er) against (er) ecology satisfy (er) satisfy their needs (er) then (er) all and they it (er) Illingt writes his article (er) called (er) consumption society from I'm not mistaken (er) they they against nature slogan (er) consuming for consumption consequently still (er) mean (er) like problems such desertification (er) deforestation scarcity resources and pollution still exist (erm) according statistics (erm) be= (er) between nineteen nineties and thousand sixteen (er) world has lost (er) we're lost about one point three (er) million square kilometers forest it's actually (er) the recovery taken into account and it's important comparison (er) the area larger than South af= South Africa (erm) (er) and people (erm) are using more and more resources produce more product goods and we know (er) that factories they (er) they cause (er) all that (er) contamination air water (er) environment general (er) and which maybe like (er) bit pity that (er) use more resources harm (er) nature live consume and live but simultaneous= sim= simultaneously are damaging the nature and fact (er) the future can like hurt as well like chain paradox actually (er) sometimes it's hard suggest some solution (er) some suggestions avoid manmade disasters but (er) try give some solutions (er) before then want say that I want say that (er) the solutions may seem banal and the they are not easy (er) imply (er) and they need (er) great amount time first all mainly (er) this society the ideology society should changed mean (er) culture= cultural values should transferred from consumptive values the economical ones (er) and secondly (er) the technology should enhanced like (er) they (er) (er) you may know (er) need technology that doesn't hurt (er) environment but that's not the only factor need (er) some kind technology that (er) will give chance (er) use (er) resources rationally (er) that's all (er) thank you for your attention and
any questions
 what you think it really because consumption culture (er) maybe is also about the (er) growth (er) popul= world population
that's one the reasons well because (er) you know (er) actually there are some more reasons for example be= being economist I understand that (erm) yeah understand that (er) the solution for this problem (er) weak and sometimes it's hard find them but (erm) you know (er) producers (er) those who produce all product for consumer goods are (er) they kill killed make enthusiastic about all thal and consumer goods actually they have some strategies like for example (er) planet soul essence and received I'm not mistaken like. for example when you shopping like when you (er) wanna like drink coffee you (er) say you know the cup plastic that plastic like bags (er) yeah therefore first full not ecofriendly and technically like (er) they are (er) when you use you just dump them right it's it's somewhat it's more that's why they the like process trashing for dumping so high it's the rate of
ok any other questions
may ask you think that this do you think that the environment and actually trying become more sustainable and eco friendly something that's important young Russian people it something your mind it that need make change the culture planet
(er) you know (er) and you know the theme products consumption but personally I'm economist mean I'm studying economics but understand that (er) it's hard and almost impossible like get rid this problem I mean people need consume right and our population growing (er) each year like became one more but anyway (er) hope that yeah actually hope that future we will able have some solution and like figure this problem out properly
thank you any more questions
well I've got question and little story (er) well first all thank you for presentation hope that will help save the planet once well I've read article about guy United States who became billionaire his thirties well was happy about this (er) he was buying lot stuff and once stopped feeling that I've got too much everything around and spend lot energy just use all this stuff and made experiment counted everything has and decided have only one hundred items well I've got only one shirt two pair socks and one bathroom and that's well one hundred items and was enthusiastic about and thinks that it's good recipe for him stop the consumption means like that you've got one hundred items and you want buy something more like one more book you should come you've got already one hundred you can not buy one more you should throw something before like not throw but well recycle donate, just sell something yeah and then you can buy one more well you think it real story for Russia because the is very popular right now there lifestyle called minimalism probably you've heard about in book and film and well people the S who have got well lot stuff buy sell and that's (er) well it it actually (er) little well it actual topic for Russia
