(eh) computer games. besides traditional computer games. multiplayer computer online games are becoming more and popular.. many them are free.. and companies (er) get (er) their revenues from (er) selling diverse number (er) additional functions and (er) game tools.. now. more than ever. gaming industry at the heart the.. entertainment business.. there are now. mo= more than (eh) two and half billion (er) gamers across the world.. combined. they spent around (er) one hundred and fifty two (er) billion dollars (er) games twenty nineteen.. course. you can see (er) forecast rise (er) the next three years...
this year. the Asia Pacific region. produced game revenues of. seventy two (er) billion dollars. accounting for forty seven percent the global total.. China remains (er) the most important market the region. for the coming years... over the past decade. (er) online games (er) have become. have become one the most. (eh) important components modern popular culture.. the (eh).. present. the number registered users (er) (er) different games. (er) are (erm) higher than (er) the population (er) different countries. you can see the screen... there are numerous objects literature (er) that are known objects virtual property. for example. you can find (er) in-game facilities (er) some (er) unlocks of. virtual objec= real objects the virtual world. such (eh) second life harbour hotel. and on...
so. part our research. have conduct. conducted survey. (er). among the students. and. so. results you can see the screen... (er) (erm) a. for results. (er) our survey. showed that most respondents. (eh) know about. such problem as. virtual. objects. thieft. in. online games. about. fourty. percent them. have been victims this. crime.. (erm) so. objects theft were mostly expensive. and despite this. people not call the police. they reckon that stolen. items can brought back. even (er) according the respondents. user agreement protect their right the Internet improperly. and is essential to. enact law. that will regulate their regulations. the Internet...
the possibility (eh) legal interference the (er) regulation relations the sphere computer games. is. highly disputed question nowadays.. (er) one the main issues (er) which (er) needs be resolved (er) whether law should. get involved virtual processes and protect (eh) gamers from the. unilateral actions (er). that are acted by. right holders and other users. who steal virtual property.. there is. (er) circle test (eh) your can see the screen. the essence (eh) which that. virtual relations. subject little regulations. (er) their participants (er) can anticipate (er) the real. consequences.. the one hand. are talking about (er).. relations. the virtual world. about the game. (er) whose nature (er) give. give gamer opportu= opportunity. act way they want real life. but the other hand. (er) is about (er) objects which have real market value. and relations. that are. but the real life real people...
. issue. so. (er) Russia relations. involving virtual property. most cases are not judiciously protected.. one the. reasons that qualifies the relations in. M games gambling and betting based the following articles.. so. (er) you see the screen (er) and will pay you. will ask you pay attention that. according law (er) gamble risk based agreement the price. howev= how= however. virtual forms. entertainments. are deprive. the most important criterium. games and betting. and risk based agreement price.. they don't even imply any winnings. don't have any and. moreover. none the existing user agreements include clause winning. that's why reckon that it. is. incorrect apply this qualification the sphere online games. it leads virtual property. not being legally protected.. (er) for instance. even Taiwan's. Chinese. and Denmark's legal systems extend property. right virtual objects and prosecute virtual. thieves. and under criminal law. conventional manner.. (er). has be mentioned. that Russian courts are gradually beginning notice. the differences between. the virtual content online. games and the gambling. the ni=. the context article (er) ten sixty two. the Russian civil code.. (er) whether not will supported other courts. only time will tell...
there are. three ways legal regulation. (er) relations. associated with (er) virtual property. (er) the first way (er) from Russian property law.. it's well known fact. (er) that. item. property. Russian property law. can only an individual item.. so. virtual objects. cannot be. (er) regulated. property law because their intangible. nature.. the American doctrine (er) vice versa. suggests (er) that (er) common (er) property law. should applied objects virtual property.. (er) supporters this doctrine. claim. that. (er) virtual objects. are intangible objects (er) special kind. occupying intermediate position between intellectual property (er). objects and (er) standard objects property. right.. (er) another point view (er) by. the professor. Bryanskiy University. says. that the term property. often used. legislation. but does not have clear definition.. the current civil code the Russian Federation.. this term used (er) different meanings (er) you can see the screen.. so. can (er). we think that virtual property. (er) regulation. can qualified (er) property right. (er) according this classification...
so (er) professor Higher School Economics (er) Moscow offers his solution.. (er) the existing pluralism. both. the legal doctrine and legislation with regard. the meaning property leads. the conclusion. that is co=. that its content may. vary. according the circumstances.. (er) so. the category (er) property. can used flexible. (er) possible include new objects that are somehow involved properties' regulation.. so. (er) out solution. that offer.. our. that offer. our own s=. (erm) project. suggest (er) add new chapter. the Russian civil code. you see the screen. (er) which will include the following features. such as. definition. general provision. process acquisition. ownership and its use. disposition. restraints. the. right. of. use. and exception virtual property.. (er) 
(er) any case over time. the need revise the traditional concept property rights. (eh) its objects and. the order their protection. order classify virtual objects will arise.. due the current trend (er) dematerialization and. property virtualization. relations. arising virtual worlds. are increasingly difficult interpret (er). way. that inherited from. Roman law... that's why. experts agree. that sooner later codes and subsequently leg= subsequently legislators. will forced. recognize (er) the reality of. virtual property in. Russian legislation...that's all. thanks your attention...
thank you.. any questions
well. guys. thank you for. (er) crucial issue. for. revising crucial issue this topic this question. and (erm) now I'm interested in. your personal opinion. in. the next question.. (erm) how you suppose (er) should we. adopt (erh) several new. legal norms order to. (er) implement. the concept of. virtual property in. (eh) civil code.. in current situation we. can deal with. concept virtual property and protect it.. so. the main purpose. (em) your study. to show how protect.. real=yep
clearly understand.. so. should we. make new norm. adopt it. or.. should use. current. legal order..
I think.. think that (er) should (er) imply. new norms (er) Russian legislation system. because (er) current (er) not give opportunity (er) protect rights the gamers (er) in. online games (er).. properly (er) and some objects that were stolen. (er) can't be. brought back. even judicially...
may continue..yeah...
(erm) that case. have (erm) open list (er) civil law objects.. right.right..
(erh) and.. don't you think that (erm) current legal picture. could use this instrument order. protect virtual property.. (erm) about (mm) half year ago. made study dedicated to. (er) legal regime of. (mm) digital. moneys.. digital currencies.. and. found out that. the main instrument. implement this concept Russian. civil (erm) law. civil code. the opened list of. (erm) civil law objects.. so. why can't we. use this instrument. order protect virtual property. can or can't. and why...
I think (er) that. is hardly possible to. use some (er) norms about.. currency. because. is (er) the (mhm) mean bank and (er) it's not object of. some. property (er) and (er) has different types of. regulation. think...
(mhm).. well. (erm) . thank you very much. that's really (er) highly discussible today. (eh) will be. the nature (er) the virtual property.. well. actually I've got some questions that. hope. would (er) help you. continue. your legal study.. well. you told that you read. some articles yes. I'm not mistaken. well. also. (er) our colleagiate Higher School Economics Moscow. and he. has got lot of. not lot of. but some good articles (erm).. in.. his book about the electronic commerce. that probably could help you. and let's from Saint-Petersburg. State University also have. also has lot articles that could help you to. continue. your. analysis.. and had some questions concerning the. legal cases Russia.. have you analyzed some them...
(er) have analyzed (erm).. this case (er) by. Leninskiy. district court Kemerovo (er) where. the judge decided to.. equate (er) the virtual property to. common property (er) Russian legislation. and (er) other. decisions (er) courts were.. (er) have restricted (er) the.. compliance (er) (er) ci= citizens...
there are some cases. where (er) judges decided qualify. this issue (er) (er) an article two s=. two seventy two. the. criminal code. the and illegal access to. the protected information. so. probably you can find some more cases there.. and there very good case. Federal tax service versus Mail.ru Games. that was the Supreme Court Russian Federation. that's why you should. well. definitely look it.. and there also. well. some. some goo=. point. that you could use your research.. well. thank you
