(em) the presented article will turn the image elder Makar representing him our point view the most vital pedagogical ideas according the writer the teacher`s identity holds primary importance what is successful achievement the teaching goals certain methods and tips just mean transmitting at teacher's wide period apprentices ... the elder Makar practical Christian (eh) that person whose thoughts wide mood set out the Orthodox tenet makes him different from other characters and draws the adolescent attention defines that differences with avoid Dostoevsky's times this word meant the unity beauty kindness and truth the process upbringing the adolescent seminars played important role since arose the student attention the teacher's personality created unnecessary conditions for the assimilation the knowledge passed to him ... (eh) this happened through the basic pedagogical method which Makar used (eh) incredibly forward his abilities and resources ... Makar's conversation could include one several people once unique feature such conversation was the fact that made his apparent uses feel if as they were equals suppose (eh) this the manifestation the Orthodox young man with the image god one soul comes first and one's individual characteristics aside ... the town meeting with Makar the adolescent's idea (eh) the meaning his life had already taken shape is also possible change on the persuasion method the compulsory condition which mutual understanding therefore the example has become the main method Makar's natural pedagogy its main form became the figural graphics stories the older showing examples the current Christian life (eh) the history about the leader mentioned Skotoboynikov and perval about Mary Egypt the particular importance example emphasized Makar's own words man lives good example Makar uses the method collision not limited the adolescent and not body well his family finds out be young man the holy church dear and the time costs for die for or wait bit not frightened and be once now perhaps you not think it afterward you will think it and something more any good thing thing yourself do it for the sake God and not for envy stand for family your course and the lack way through any sort qualities the Russian turning about well that all wanted tell you only custom yourself pray daily and unseasonably last Makar's wise actualized one more pedagogical method exercise result Arkady wants pray loans the rules rituals the Christian life all specious and humility to sum Dostoevsky shows that pedagogy effectiveness the term primarily the teacher's pay and body his life Makar applies the methods pedagogy anomaly but achieves its main goal (eh) his apprentices burdens falls destructively dangerous goal and begins form the idea new the new idea only need idea says Arcady (eh) Makar's pedagogy became natural extension Christian life and this method tradition Orthodox church and teaching further development this idea will in measure atheism seen the novel Karamazov brothers (eh) text analysis confirmed (eh) some changes Arcady's characters and Arcady's idea Makar's appearance Arcady's stimuli his rightist step appeared be the most profound impressive for the adolescent starts bill the earning for these seminars a cleanness of that dirty unclean idea (eh) happens and results it Arcady's renounce from his old idea his refusal blackmailing Akhmakova with the letter and the creation the notes know novel from now from now does not pop the text often it used do the beginning the novel Arcady admit that all needed was father loved much was unbearable he says need dream anymore everything need you keeps (eh) rational idea aback and size end the University doctrine Makar was that equally beautiful was able replace Arcady's idea fill idea one (eh) that all wanted say thank you for your listening you have any question please feel free ask them

thank you ... wanted ask you your personal (eh) view you have the situation people coming church and there churchman priest who explains things them will you call this situation situation pedagogic


thank you much for your question actually is hard tell (eh) because (eh) need understand what remain what mean (em) this concept


that question was about actually well how you understand pedagogy then


I think that pedagogy process (eh) well person (eh) tell (eh) something other and make=makes his world view change that's pedagogy main goal my point view


well then when boss tells something do and that changes behaviour (eh) way teaching yeah whatever that pedagogy


I think is (em) because way use pedagogy something that happens only school teacher talked his students and (em) and they tell something educational them actually is not pedagogy a general meaning it's the impact one person has act another


isn't that too broad because are influent yeah are influencing people all the time anywhere the whole life pedagogy them everything involve pedagogy isn`t that too broad be definite concept then


well think has something do with (eh) the amount impact have every person (em)


yeah probably that what mean probably this something else that should define from the very beginning and then follow that understanding (eh) another one wanted ask you you showed the interesting (eh) wouldn't call that pedagogical methods plural but some steps the five steps that make pedagogical method yeah and this succession probably important here (eh) does this succession remind any the existing pedagogical systems before Dostoevsky. isn't borrowed any kind pedagogical school


(em) well my mind seems like pedagogical methods (em) have produced any writers since (eh) yes Dostoevsky borrowed some pedagogical ideas but made them look special because combined those ideas with the Orthodox standard and was his special feature


yeah what mean do you know any (eh) pedagogical schools which employ similar methods and Dostoevsky maybe closed some them


unfortunately didn't study question carefully don't know any pedagogical schools


yeah probably that would my second step doing the research work like yours if Dostoevsky pedagogue he's implying some kind systems his novel what (eh) the (eh) was the previous experience that sphere looks someone else he`s unique the world view that can understand only through comparing him something else outside his novel
