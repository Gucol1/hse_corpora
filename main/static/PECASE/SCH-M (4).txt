 that case I`ll begin (eh) today (eh) the I`ll introduce myself first all name my name am from Rostov-on-Don I'm studying lyceum fifty-seven and today I'd like talk about fake news and development media literacy (eh) today the era post-truth one the significant phenomena the media environment fake news deliberately distorted deceitful news content fake news spread through wide variety channels often affecting information consumers negative destructive way (er) this phenomenon attracts the attention scientists journalists IT-specialists and other professionals connected with information (er) need analyse fake news order help media users detect fakes and develop information verification skills ... (er) the word fake borrowed into Russian from English here are some definitions from the dictionaries (er) you can see them the screen right now (er) the definitions demonstrate the main feature fakes they're deceitful nature they're the fact that they contain untruthful information (em).. in short can define fake news deliberately deceitful news ... (em) today observe the change the whole structure news consumption traditional news channels for example (er) are losing ground electronic media social networks and especially messengers (er) why fake news published the one hand (er) fakes are tool for manipulating the audience (er) the other hand (er) today's media space fakes are popular way making financial profit audience reach and engagement are monetised the profit fake news authors depend clicks reposting comments is important note the negative indignant responses (er) are less profitable because they increase the engagement which mentioned earlier (er) there are various classifications which won't dwell detail but you feel free ask questions the end you want to (er) into any more depth them (em) ... let's see example fake that quite dangerous because how truthful sounds contains completely false information but causes big emotional reaction supposedly pretended volunteers from various parties are giving out face masks soaked drugs their aim robbing people during the pandemic this information grabs the recipient's attention and motivates them with the best intentions share this fake with the wide audience fortunately the fake was refuted the ministry internal affairs the rostov region and over twenty other sources like the fake the disclaimer also went viral but least was truthful (em) ... part my research sorry (mm) ... there go (em) as part my research created survey (em) thanks social networks involved wide audience three hundred and fifty-five respondents the survey included nineteen questions here I'll only comment few key questions and results (em) generally the respondents demonstrated high level mistrust towards any news sources the survey ... confirmed the most the users not have any strategies identifying fake news dealing with they know little about tools information verification and the very need for such verification not obvious all but this subject definitely perceived topical (em) the vast majority eighty-seven point six percent find news the internet most commonly messenger sixty-four point nine percent ... (em) you can see the slide right now ... (em) next the absolute majority respondents know about fake news (er) ninety-eight percent and most have come across fake news ninety four point four percent (er) to which sources can trusted seventy-seven point five percent said that lies can encountered any source ... (eh) ... for the main aim (er) developing media literacy this connection the question (er) what you (er) you doubt truthfulness the news very important one (er) here are the leading answers (er) tried check the validity the news with special websites and tools thirty-nine point two percent and tried find other news the topic thirty point seven percent seven point nine percent the respondents not believe that it's important differentiate between truthful and false news which quite sad from the point view media literacy ... (em) many respondents appeared well-informed about the different ways verifying information but thirty-seven point two percent stated that they knew nothing about them all ... sorry sorry seventy-nine point seven percent the respondents would like know more about the methods and tools information verification which shows that it's topical issue not only for resort searchers but for wide range users ... used the term verification denote checking the validity information included the piece news it's vast topic but here we'd like offer simple short guidelines which should not require any specific knowledge skills (er) here are these guidelines opinion news (er) which important because opinions can't fake because they're (er) subjective check the news against common sense and general scientific knowledge (er) check the source (er) official private valid not (er) what the website's training rating and authority check the links they lead anywhere check against other sources the information published anywhere else (er) any deviations search for possible disclaimers does the headline match the content make sure the headline not looking for sensation is not click bait (er) nature information check that it's not too general all countries all animals cetera check numbers and stats where they come from who gathered them researchers (er) scientific institutions they match the descriptions these are those are the guidelines (em) and another example fake news recently some truly sensational information started (er) spreading social media supposedly (er) young couple from Norilsk had baby who according his mom right after was delivered clearly said papa and the very next day could talk distinctly and even form questions the happy parents both nineteen explain this the abundant attention they had given the baby before birth talking him reading fairy tales and singing songs this piece news doesn't even pass the second point our guidelines because doesn't stand common sense and doesn't match our basic ideas about physiology luckily soon after the first wave proposed number disclaimers were published ... the main conclusion can make today (er) that is important for every person raise the level their media literacy the more informed the user about possible lies the new the less they can manipulated and involved misinformation that generates internet traffic and revenue for certain beneficiaries basically out nothing (er) hope there are guidelines which will certainly further analysed and improved can become useful this process thank you ... your microphone

internet  feel like that's something that definitely for (er) debate because (er) mentioned (er) most respondents and kind agree with this that (er) you can find (er) information that isn't true basically any source (er) and but ... depends think feel like the (er) source that provides the most fake information the internet just because there the most information there general feel like

second question (eh) why fake news appear why they appear well (er) discussed this briefly the start the presentation (er) feel like the two main reasons for why fake news would appear was (er) either manipulate audience into believing something into thinking something into adopting certain opinion way thinking just for monetary gain because said (er) certain methods spreading fake news can monetised and thus audience engagement (er) earns the public your money yeah like money and manipulation are the two main reasons okay thank you thank you for such interesting topic nowadays it`s actual like (eh) have the never before can you answer please what reasons people have read fake news fake information about each other just mentioned feel like (er) someone spreads fake information
