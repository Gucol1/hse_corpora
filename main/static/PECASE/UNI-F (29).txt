 will the next speaker. you're welcomesorry there any time for five minutes. seven..ok.good day dear colleagues name and the topic my work modeling consumers actions the sharing economy. (em) first all (er) despite the fact that (er) the idea (er) renting (erm) not is is. sorry not new phenomenon (er) the (er) the idea renting not from organizations but also from consumers (er) has occured (erm) just recently (er) you can see the (erm) sha=of the sharing economy was Airbnb eighty eight (eh) twenty eight (erm) and this firm .these its aim (eh) to (er).. to. offer some (er) home some. some houses for (er) travelers and then eighty ten Uber has come (eh) has the market and all (eh) know the purpose this firm. and nowadays there are lots organizations which (erm) offer some rental boots for example (erm) some (eh) clothes (er) cars (erm) and different different (er) goods. (er) (erm) the objective my work determine what characteristics does the concept sharing economy include. and identify the conditions under which economic agents become participants this economy and (erm) how this phenomenon affect the choice agents and affect the economy whole. (erm) first all (eh) need (er) say that (er) this term not (erm).. identified all ath=authors (er) use different syn=synonymous you can see them the screen and (eh). (er) determine own. determination sharing economy based different authors and (eh) sharing economy model economy. based the possibility temporary use goods without personal and any consumer who has property and ready share (eh) can act producer here (erm).. (erm) while analyse some (em) some (em) theoretical works (erm) extract (eh) characteristics affecting the economic agents (er) first all (er) the sharing economy (er) expand the selection desired product service which leads. opportunity (er) find (eh) project which will best meet (erm) the needs consumer moreover (er) the sharing economy (em).. create additional income for consumers participation sellers and consumers. (em) and (er) one more benefit that (er) the sharing economy (er) create cost reduction which leads lower prices and (eh) shift there conception work product better quality (er) now people can (em) consumpt some product better quality but. for (eh) lower prices. and some characteristics that affect the economy whole.. first all (er) the sharing economy help (eh) help create new benefits from trade between consumers (erm) (em) then (er) moreover can (er) (eh) due sharing economy (erm) the competitiveness the market increase (er) and then additional income for unemployed people people with lower incomes (erm)... came (erm).. (er) (mm) middle (er). (eh) middle some my work (er) characteristics which has (eh) different effect (er) economical agents. and now want (er) understand (erm).. for what reason (er) agents (er) start (er) participant (er) sharing economy and for this analyze theoretical model Webber and let's (er) let's (eh) let explain what is. this model there are (eh) one product. is single product market. two economic agents and two roles (erm) consumer consumer and consumer owner. (er) there are infinite number steps and agents make (er) can make choice every step these model. (er) the consu=consumer strategies are purchase good from retailer from seller (eh) (er) not purchase good lease good from owner. and owner strategies. (er) the=there are two them. rent good use good (er) himself herself. (em) in the screen you can see model this graph. and there are.. there are lots steps (erm) the and they are cycled here. (er)... (erm) for (eh).. (eh) find out that there are characteristics types economic agents (eh) throughout the whole life cycle and characteristic concrete economic agents concrete period time. (er) characteristics types are theta and theta for consume goods and value that (er) the product can bring. and (eh) concrete and charectic concrete economic agent S. the need the product. and theta S (erm). have (em) (er) some (er) links (er) theta sets the change path at each step. theta like probability for be zero one. to.. this val=value. (er). (em). (er) the expected consumer's utility. (er) taking into account that the discount factor (er). that our (er) that our agents (er) dico=discounted their (mm) utilities (eh) the expected consumer's utility step can written the equation number one. (eh) there are (em) there (eh) maximization three (er) gains from three strategies. (eh) and then (er) we (er) see (mm). (eh) graph again can see that consumer (eh) its (er).. letter has equal strategies each step (er) his her (eh) utility each step will equal. (er) and this equation number two. (erm) and (er). apply this factor can rewrite (er) expected consumer utility. equation number three. (er) but (er) let's put practice the idea that consumers has. agents has different types and (eh) different characteristics and (em).. let's create market here. (er) (em).. theta probability for and can create from these market its matrix transaction the need for the project from state one zero (er) and vice-versa (erm) will the probabilities. here (eh) it's like theta but (er) there are two kind now (eh) from zero one from zero zero and zero one from one zero and one one. values. and (er) apply this factor can rewrite (erm) (er) owners utility and then consumers utility (em) this equations you can see (er) the screen and (mm)... (eh).. the sense this equation that maximize all (erm) all gains from all strategies one period time (em) and you can see that the result for owners utility (er) (em). depend only of (eh) depend only on probability price and its own characteristic. but we write (eh) the expected utility for the consumer can see that the result depend. not only (er) price probability (er) values (eh) but (em) expected probability from the next period. and it's problem (er) which will (er) solve my next research (er) due (er) equation. as result before deciding enter the sharing economy model the agent observe for expected utilities and (er) solve the maximization problem (erm).. and conclusion want say that (er) there are some limitations my work. course and (er) want make future search where determine the expected utility (em) due Belmont equation and then explore there are some shareable resources not. (er) thanks for your attention I'm ready for your questions
 you're welcome. any questions
as said before going say attending some presentations and having fun so. what going say is.. not I'm good So.. the presentation really good. you have to give and you have something say. about the situation. about think that the beginning spoke about uber and airnb know that socially but no. there something what's are right this something and there something notice that you (er) down your write.. then 
There yesbecause i'm not (er) ready with speech.. yes and there are some (er) helpful words
notes>
yes
notes. okay thanks those notes really small okay 
like parts
 and this something appreciate and like (er) thing that you (er) you said something about the future plans.. like this going be next more about this and this really good. but but you want be good presenter like it's not about it's about being (eh) challenge something that like this kind thing look this. okay. hope that gonna good attempt the next presentation. okay
thank you
thank you 
your speech was really great and have question about and practical significance your model. (er) tell please (er) which way your model can help top managements developing any kind decision
(mhm) (em) let think.. top management decision (er) (er) this model can (mm)... can better can (er) and then (er) (er) now have (er) equation maximization and (eh) can (er) make some (er) our own prices (er) (em) create our own (erm) consumer (em) as top management know our consumers. and create their values and thetas (er) can understand (em) what (em) how high can our price. will the price our project (erm) order (em) make (er) order our (er) consumer make the choice our (er) firm are not rental firm for example..
okay thank you very much
is your course paper
yes. course paper
and future research for your (er) this proposal
yes
(mhm)
thank you
well thank you
