Introduction
The aim of research work is a legal analysis of the legal signs of fraud in lending sphere, its delimitation from the adjacent acts, identification of problematic issues of qualification and ways of their decisions. The paper contains theoretical and empirical research methods for accurate and complete disclosure of the stated theme issues. The anticipated result of this study is a proposal of solutions to problems associated with qualification of fraud in lending sphere. The structure of our research work consists of three chapters, each of whom has three paragraphs.
Background. Relevance of the touched topic is growing every year. Fraud in lending sphere is a crime that has taken root in our country, it is becoming increasingly dangerous, and thus there are difficulties in the development of the most effective forms of counteracting both at the level of legal regulation and legal application.
Annually more than 25 thousand persons are condemned for committing fraud in Russia. It is obvious that this crime is one of the most widespread acts in various spheres of economic activity. According to official figures, more than 2,5 thousand persons are convicted for a fraud in the sphere of lending in 2011 that represents more than 10% of the total number of the convicted persons under Article 159 of the Russian Criminal Code 
Problem statement. The purpose of this paper is a legal analysis of the legal signs of fraud in lending sphere, its delimitation from the adjacent acts, identification of problematic issues of qualification and ways of their decisions. Based on the aim of our work following tasks are exuded:
1. to consider the object and objective signs of fraud in lending sphere;
2. to reveal the subject and subjective signs of fraud in lending sphere;
3. to delimit the fraud in lending sphere from the adjacent acts;
4. to disclose the problems associated with qualification of fraud in lending sphere;
5. to suggest ways to improve the rules of fraud in lending sphere.
Professional significance. The topic of our research is not sufficiently developed today, since the norm is relatively new in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, but, despite this, there is a practical basis for anti-fraud experience in lending sphere. There are a number of problems which demand revision and more detailed studying or other progressive approach. Scientific and practical significance of the work lies in the fact that the paper contains the analysis, conclusions and suggestions, which can be used in efforts to improve the article 159.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, dedicated to the fraud in lending sphere. Also in the paper we propose a number of solutions to the problems associated with the qualification of this type of fraud. It should be noted that the work differs in scientific novelty, which consists in identification of details which can complicate qualification of fraud in sphere of lending in practice.
Delimitations of the study. The main focus of the research is identification of the significant problems associated with the qualification of fraud in lending sphere, and finding ways of their decision. Despite the fact that the work reveals the general characteristics of fraud in lending, we pay more attention to the problems of posed theme. At the end of 2012 a separate article in the Criminal code of Russian Federation was introduced, but it did not solve all the problems. It should be noted that most of the problems arise with the delimitation of fraud in lending from adjacent crimes, such as the main structure of fraud, illegal reception of the credit, various civil torts. In our paper, we pay attention to these aspects. 
Literature review
Credit relations are developing rapidly, and at the same time evolving criminal activity in this area, including fraud. Preparation for this crime often takes quite a bit of time, because simply by deception or abuse of trust to seize money of lender by creating the image of a bona fide borrower. In this regard, lenders often suffer in credit relations. The same opinion has McLaughlin in his study «Detecting Fraud in Small Business Lending». McLaughlin argues that lenders need to be protected against fraud in the first place. To help bank employees identify cases of credit fraud more effectively, researcher proposed a few pointers that may indicate illegal activity. The author also offers some advices to creditors how to work with credit agents.
Working with credit agents, creditors need to consider some indicators of possible fraud schemes. It is necessary to be careful if the credit agent:
* has history of early non-payments;
* provides incomplete information;
* controls all interactions between the creditor and the borrower.
The creditors may protect themselves from unscrupulous lending agents. To do this, they must:
* ask for advice from other creditors;
* search the Internet for information about credit agents, for example, information about previous bankruptcies or business licenses;
* communicate directly with the borrowers;
* use their own evaluators.
As mentioned above, the fraud in lending sphere is gaining serious momentum, which hinders the development of credit market. Lekan expresses a similar point of view in his paper «Are you sure those loan losses are not fraud?». The researcher argues that fraud in the area of lending is growing exponentially. This type of fraud can deplete millions of dollars of business in less time than it takes to read a small book. The author believes that the main cause of credit fraud is the theft of people personal information. Fraudsters use stolen personal information to get a loan or credit, which may vary from hundreds of thousands of dollars to a million dollars or more. 
Lekan distinguishes following terms of stimulating the growth of fraud in lending:
* the competition among creditors who offer the simplest and quickest way of loan or credit provision;
* automation. Computers process information very quickly and facilitate the loan approval process today. However, automation has a significant disadvantage. As soon as the fraudsters ascertain «system», automation in fact helps them to repeat the fraud at the computer speed;
* tampering. Now it is very easy to spoof practically any documents: documents on the property, the tax returns, passports and so on. Fraudsters often take credits using fraudulent documents;
This is not an exhaustive list actually. With crime growth are rising methods of committing fraud in lending.
Also the author offers the ways of credit fraud prevention:
* try to understand the fraudulent schemes and methods of their commission and learn to reveal them;
* search information about clients from all available resources as much as possible;
* make sure that people have been working with clients, not computers. In fact, people are much more smart and suspicious towards clients. Bank employees at times better know clients than computers;
* select staff carefully to protect themselves from fraud;
* communicate with the client. You shall know to whom give the credit;
* make a list of questions and ask the right questions to the client, to reasonably decide to give him a credit or not;
* fight against counterfeiting using special devices and additional human effort.
This is not an exhaustive list in fact. Each organization is obliged to develop strategies and methods for effectively fighting with credit fraud.
Many researchers believe that the injured parties are only banks and credit organizations in the fraud in lending. Murzina has the opposite opinion. The author believes that in some cases this type of crimes is committed by the banks themselves. First of all, it is connected with the competition of banks. Also, banks are trying to hide the facts of the fraud committed by borrowers to maintain a good reputation. Banking organizations increase the interest rate on the loan to increase revenue or to cover the loss, but respectable borrowers suffer from it. The researcher argues that for the prevention of fraud in lending following measures are required:
* conducting prevention works among employees of financial institutions, directed on compliance of legal provisions and internal regulations, rules and procedures by them;
* professional training of appropriate services responsible for ensuring the safety and protection of the interests of these institutions;
* conducting special audits with the assistance of external experts to detect irregularities in the paperwork;
* systematic study of the risks and development of measures for the effective management of these risks.
To defeat the fraud in lending is practically impossible only with the help of criminal law. The interest of banks to issue of the unsecured loans in order to increase its loan portfolio, actively contributes to the commission of fraud in lending. Before the adoption of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation of appropriate response measures, law enforcement agencies, for objective reasons, can not effectively confront the fraud in lending.
As mentioned above, Article 159.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation was introduced relatively recently (in December 2012). However, the introduction of this type of fraud did not solve the main problems associated with the qualification of this crime. Polyansky considers that the main positive factor of the consolidation of this type of crime in the norms of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation is the mitigation of the criminal liability. Anchoring in the Russian criminal legislation of the fraud in lending in a separate article did not solve all the problems of criminal legal qualification of this crime. The formulation of the separate features included in the article can not be considered perfect because this crime does not cover all cases of theft of another's property by the borrower by providing a bank or other lender false information. However, considering prevalence of committing fraud in lending, to overcome the disadvantages of the concept of crime by making changes to criminal law and publication of clarification of the Supreme Court must be regarded as reasonable and appropriate step. 
Methods
Under the methods of research, we understand the techniques, procedures and operations of theoretical and empirical knowledge and study of the phenomena of reality. Using the methods we have reliable information that is used for the construction of scientific theories and the development of practical recommendations. Research methods system is determined by the original concept of the researcher: his ideas about the essence and the structure of study, the overall methodological orientations, goals and objectives of a particular study. We use the following methods in our work: formal legal method, method of comparative legal analysis, induction and deduction. 
Formal legal technique involves the study of law, without reference to other social phenomena. The study of the internal structure of legal norms and law in general, the analysis of sources (forms) of law, methods of systematization of normative material, the rules of legal technique.
The comparative legal method in the methodology of State and law is one of the main ways of knowing. It implies comparison of processes, phenomena and concepts of a legal nature in order to study their similarities, identifying the causes of differences.
Induction is a method of thinking, a consequence of which is the logical conclusion, in which the general conclusion is derived from the private.
Deduction is a way of thinking, a consequence of which is the logical conclusion, in which a private conclusion is derived from the general.
Results Anticipated
Based on the objectives of our work, we hope to achieve some of the main results which are shown below. 
Firstly, we have to identify the object and the subject of fraud in lending sphere by means of Part 1 of Article 159.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. Also, using this norm, we need to reveal the objective and the subjective aspects of this crime.
Secondly, we have to distinguish the fraud in lending sphere from related offenses, in order to understand how correctly qualify this crime. We delimitate fraud in lending from the main structure of fraud, illegal reception of the credit and from various civil torts.
Thirdly, the study presents problems associated with qualification of fraud in lending sphere due to incorrect interpretation of the norm and the lack of appropriate legal comments to this norm of the Criminal code of Russia. We suggest ways of the norm improving and other decisions of the stated problems.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it should be noted that the relevance of our research work is undeniable, as the fraud in lending is a crime that can be called a «tumor» in our society. This type of crime affects the different subjects: the creditors and debtors (both legal entities and ordinary citizens). The work is presented both in practical and theoretical aspects. In the introduction of the work we have pointed out the purpose and objectives of our research, which we hope to achieve with the help of legislation, court practice, various scientific articles, monographs, theses. However, it also should be noted that the stated topic will be relevant for a long time, since the problem of fraud is a very serious and debatable among lawyers.
