 so and our first speaker today (er) is ..  who is going to talk (er) to give a talk on the following topic some thoughts about the problem of stray dogs in the twenty first century case study of the UK the USA and Russia Perm so welcome  
… 
(er) .. hello to everyone. my name is  and (eh) today I will speak about the problem of homeless dogs in the twenty first century (er) in different countries (er) such as (er) Russia the United Kingdom and (eh) the USA . have you ever seen homeless animals in the streets of our city . I am sure you have seen at least a couple of them over the last few days . but why is it a problem . why are people alarming by this .. (er) to say the least stray dogs can be dangerous . they can attack and bite people . also they can spread various diseases like rabies which can be fatal for people . is any government policy procedures in our country . the original laws regulating the dog population seem to be quite ineffective . in Perm kray people who are monitoring the dog population are non-governmental animal organizations and volunteers … (mhm) on January first twenty nineteen a new federal law about responsible treatment of animals came into effect as an official support to this local activity .. for example in the United States of America (er) the laws about responsible treatment of animals are issued at state federal and municipal levels .. each state has a right to introduce their own laws and (er) .. directions to (er) dogs . and for example in the United Kingdom (er) the law prescribes several types of punishment for people who tries to violate the law . from large fines to imprisonment . and in the relation to it we have decided to evaluate the situation with stray dogs in Perm to check if the law has started to bring any results as well as to compare the situation in different countries in the United Kingdom and the United States … we launched an anonymous  survey (er) in three countries Perm in Russia Perm United Kingdom and the United States . (er) to find out people’s opinions on this problem . (er) we are conducting this survey among young adults age seventeen thirty five and we’ve received (er) .. twenty answers from the States and eleven from the UK . (er) so the main question of our research was what this situation with stray dogs and the attitude towards them ... and there you can see the questions which we also asked … (er) the results of our survey in Perm are the following . all of our respondents agreed that this problem exists and is urgent .  also all of them noted that there are a lot of stray dogs in their neighborhoods … (er) maybe .. (er) fifteen or twenty five dogs in each .. (erm) .. (em) the question about the necessity of feeding dogs got different replies because people have such a dilemma if we feed them the number grows but a third of our respondents said that it is cruel not to feed them also about (eh) half of them would like to adopt one but they don’t have an opportunity to do this .. to get an idea of the attitude over street animals (em) in different countries we asked the same questions to people from the United Kingdom and the UK . moreover I am a member of  postcrossing community and (er) I asked people from all over the world (er) also this question and I got replies from Asian European and Post Soviet countries … (em) .. the situation in United States (mm) is not (eh) perfect . according to the reports from the rest there are a lot of stray dogs but there are rescue centers which keep and (er) . put (eh) into shelters or hostel until adoption .. unlike in Perm not all respondents said that it’s a big problem and (eh) the number of people who are not afraid of stray dogs in the in the (er) USA is equal to the number of people in Perm who afraid of them .. (er) about half of the respondents would like to adopt a dog . and (eh)  the number of British respondents is twice as small as the number of (er) the respondents the number of the respondents from the UK (er) the trends in both countries are the same . nearly all of respondents said that there are no stray dogs in their neighborhoods . (eh) also fifth admitted it’s to be a problem .. (eh) due to the lack of experience with stray dogs about seventy percent replied that they are not afraid of the dogs … (mhm) … (er) so there you can see the results from the postcrossing (er) .. (er) .. the situation in Europe is quite good there are rescue centers and some special animal animal organizations in (eh) Asia the situation (mm) is (eh) .. (eh) the same but for example in Kuala Lumpur .. (er) .. the situation is (eh) not very good . and Post Soviet countries are represented by Belarus .. (er) where the problem is similar to Perm ... (er) our hypothesis has been  the situation with homeless dogs in the United States and UK is generally more optimistic than in Perm . the trend in the USA is similar to the trend in the UK . both countries recognize that this problem exists despite the small number of stray dogs in neighborhoods . the governments of the USA and UK are taking an active role in solving this problem unlike in (er) unlike the Russian (er) .. government . (eh) in Perm stray dogs can be found in almost every neighborhood and many citizens are afraid of them..  (eh)  the Russian government has finding a great potential to this problem and introduce the law that will (eh) control and improve the situation .. (eh) as for me now the stray dogs are everywhere but not everywhere that we   in the same way .. (er) now the only thing we can do is to .. (er) feed stray dogs if we see them and I think that the situation will change (eh) with the introduction of the new law thank you for your attention 
 thank you so any questions to the speaker .. you are welcome 
 I have a question  thank you for your presentation (er) .   I can see the reference to the twenty first century  and .. a I wonder why. it is why you are talking about twenty first century doing compare with twentieth century or maybe nineteenth century or could you please just clarify this reference to the twenty first century 
  (uhu) 
 (mm) I speak about twenty first century because I think that we should speak about the present time and (eh) try to solve the problem and (eh) I think it is necessary to speak about the past 
 well sometimes it is (er) but (eh) when you use (eh) special reference  to (eh) .. any history period  you should to use it somehow in your presentation 
  (uhu)
