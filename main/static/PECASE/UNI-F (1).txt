our next participant (em) have two participants actually that and with the report called the art pharmaceutical naming basic principles and customers' opinion
well hello everyone is 
and name 
we are students from perm state pharmaceutical academy and want present our work the art pharmaceutical naming basic principles and customers—ç opinion
we live don't we
 one famous American poet once noticed life pharmaceutical from head All his words were decided present devoted pharmaceutical drug nomination
this topic relevant because future pharmacists should aware the main principles drug naming and the impact pharmaceutical drug names customers' intentions buy them
as you can see from the slide our report has the following objectives summarize general information about drug drug naming (em) figure out the main principles giving trade names medicine and review the result our own survey
so it's well known that for any pharmacy customer, the name drug an important source primary information about Many drugs have two names international non-proprietary name and trade name the international non-proprietary name used identify pharmaceutical substance active ingredient is scientific and quite often difficult pronounce and memorize trade name what truly remember is field where the art pharmaceutical language starts blossom
a pharmaceutical company can give its medicine trade name based set rules established the certain state authorities we have found out the perfect name should fit the following criteria the name cannot sound look like another drug product
this for example true about Xanax and Actually medical error one causes the heart disease and 
also the name cannot make any medical claims only promotional and the name cannot serve broaden education minimize the risk mislead
after all the name should bright and appealing customer
A name blended from many languages based four distinct donations. visuality melodic ant rest mobile velocity and language naturality
There are also different things be mentioned lapis y often can great names because they can attract high tech science fiction saluting for example Clerics Styrene Zosyn points would in man crew way create Desoptesal (erm). swing seasonal but feel that was SJW types awarded because they are difficult pronounce and need images and some hard pronounce trade names telling gin that your 
Isotuclone
Idernuzelubap
Levitirocipam
and 
While pronouncing such names famous English joke comes mind and with his prescription
oh I've never thought about and (erm) two famous and very successful examples drug drugs drug names are Aspirin and Viagra
speaking about Aspirin is clear that stands for aether s stands for spirtzer and is popular suffix for drugs those day days easy pronounce and remember isn't it
of course
and the name Viagra was given Pfizer's blockbuster product after the work with urologists most patients visualized strong stream when describing when describing the condition the name Viagra was (erm) created through through melding the words vigorous and Niagara 
nowadays there there are two main approaches drug names heuristic and according the heuristic approach relationship more positive broad complex drug names contrast suggest the same effect for voicing the drug names
to assess the reliability this conducted questionnaire with follow interviews among 100 young people aged from eighteen twenty-five from Perm the respondents were given the list drugs names that you can see the slide and they were asked about the ones they prefer buy
about fifty percent the respondents choice highly conventional popular drug names with oblique (em) well about ten percent voting for trade name containing chemical composition barest sence the remaining forty percent would choose the name implying drug's usage but the same time generally complex drug names are seen more hazardous than simple drug names which negatively influenced, but really was fine
Indeed Charlie once noticed modern medicine have name for everything but cure for nothing
 want emphasize once again that lot instances connected with drug naming especially when commercial context linked with customers ecology 
thank you for your attention any questions are welcome
thank you girls who one will ask them questions
I have one question
Yes
do understand you right that (em) you asked (em) some participants the survey (em) what (em) kind (em) drug would they buy according their name what they usually buy
Thank you for your question yes yes
No that part the question want understand whether understand right
yes you understand right
so what you usually buy according the name
no what would you choose
huh what would you choose
yes
and (em) don't you think the choice connected not only with the name the drug but with its (em) effectiveness
properties this drug
yes are we are agree because (erm) some people buy drugs looking their name. but some people buy drugs looking their properties .because (em) they think they know the properties this drug and they buy them (em) usually these drugs are named (em) INMM this chemical (em) containing chemical composition but (em) usually pe= people buy drugs (em).. that you can see advertisement for example TV .for example (em) strepsils and so
do you think this good way name drugs
trade name (em) mis= chemical composition
no you know which one you think better
We think that (em) is better name drugs (em) like trade names like Strepsils because is (em) easy pronounce and remember because its containing (em).. needed letters this name we think that (em). the trade name is. (em) better for people

but for pharmacists because are ph= future pharmacists is better 
we prefer choose (em) for chemical na= names containing chemical composition properties maybe because can understand (em) where its from what its for and can understand action with 
Do you think that there any there are any correlations connections between the price the product and its name
yes thank you for your question yes course (em) there are there connection the price and name because for example (em) strepsils viks has higher price for example we buy another product analog Russian analog another analog with another name not trade name and not memorable
and with the that its better spend some money creation names trade names than just spends
and you think that there some connection between the name drug and its benefits like drug with famous with catchy name can heal you faster than the one with unknown name
 thank you for your question well maybe may= maybe when people take the drug they think about and they become (em) healthy more fa= faster 
is 
yes
