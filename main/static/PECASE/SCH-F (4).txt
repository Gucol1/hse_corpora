good afternoon. ladies and gentlemen. name I'm student and I'd like introduce you my research work which called women's objectification advertising. so.. (eh) over the last decade significant shift roles (er) roles man and woman has been discernible. women obt= have obtained more emphatic position their society. however. this cannot seen (eh) advertising and marketing industry (er). where woman's body is. (er) still used attract attention and sometimes (er) there typical content with the. gender roles and. (er) shows women submissive (er) unintelligent overly sexualized.. so. my research work have hypothesis that this objectification (eh) advertising has influence sale increasement.. so. let's start with defining what advertising. advertising any paid form non–personal perse= presentation or and promotion ideas goods and services through mass media such as. newspapers magazines internet something else... well. is is really widespread (er) consumer exposed between three thousand and ten thousand (eh) ads each day. well. (er) let's look how objectification gained popularity. (er) was firstly advertisers eighteen seventy-one and (er) shows naked woman the back .. well (er) and the (er) nineteen-eighties the assumption sex sells was truly relevant (er) the picture (er) the usage objecti= objectification sorry tripled actually. and.. let's find out what objectification. for guess (er) the most accurate definition would (er) using woman mostly decorative attraction getting objects. with little no relevance the product advertised. what's more here are some notions which advertisement which objectification advertising might occur and what more there are pictures that are great examples that guess and great examples definition. should say because it's ads suits. men suits 
 clearly.../B> 
 well. there suit. so.. various researchers' opinions the usefulness objectification advertisements are distinguished (er) the one hand (er) such content attracts (er) people's attentions and the other hand (er) some found that causes effect even when the moral.. when the morally unjust contact shown (er) causes negative attitudes.. so.. (er) gather (er) information (er) within our research work. (er) conducted survey. firstly decided gather information about characteristics respondents such gender and age (er) then (er) focused figuring out their feelings towards different adv= advertisements (er) which shows different ways objectification. thirdly respondents had choose product basing only ads. one there was objectification. other one there was no. and. finally the respondents had assess themselves. whether (er) objectification engaged them buy something not. so. here are pictures that were shown our survey. they had (er) express their feelings towards that (er) left one is oh it's right one but used left guess that with red words which should not pronounce guess and then they had choose between different ads shows suits and jeans. so. the results the survey are that most participants were female and were aged between seventeen and twenty-five (er) the. (er) feelings towards objecti= objectifying ads can described angry furious (er) what's more approximately approximately well this one (er) I'm sorry. sixty-six and (er) ninety-four percents respondents had chosen buy products that (er) which ads contained objectification.. (er) and finally (er) thirty-two percents respondents answered that objectification didn't engage them buy versus only three percent respondents answered that objectification engaged them buy something.. so. all all could have observe that objectification does not increase (er) any consumers purchase intention well it (er) increa= not doesn't increase any sales which makes our hypothesis which was put down the beginning come the end. thank you for your attention and (er) I'm ready answer any questions you might have 
 just want clarify (er) thank you for your presentation. did you explain your respondents the survey (er) what the objecti= objectification 
 yes. course
 so. the beginning the survey 
 yes. first question actually was you know what objectification and then (er) gave the definition. and even. actually. showed even greater example objectification which video 
 but don't you think that this could also influence the results 
 yes probably could influence the results (er) and thought about that but. but there are many other things that could influence that (er) even the simplest one (er) where the respondents actually. for example feminist maybe and girls. they might feminists. it also (er) affects results 
 so. for your future research. how you think these limitations could overcome 
 guess. more personal approach. for example. (er) may conduct not survey but interview guess (er) we can find out not onl= the results then would more will more sorry I'm quite nervous (er) results will much more accurate guess
 thank you... how harmful you think this continuing objectification the trajectory feminism and also just men's opinions and attitudes women general 
 well. my work there are. expressed the topic harmfulness objectification and the main one (er) that these girls ads are (eh) course photoshopped and are overly sexualized. young girls who are looking these ads are feeling not comfortable with own bodies and (er) they might exp= experiencing lower self-esteems they might experience even eating disorders (er) order be much more skinny 
 and you think that this taking men see women only assexual objects 
 yes. course. personally believe that men don't see like this and they are interacting with real women every day.. still (er) showing (er) women for example submissive can little bit change their attitude toward= towards us.. that they might think that can (mm) persuaded do something for example (er) only because are shown weak persons 
 you compared the objectification advertising Russia and the rest the world. it worse here elsewhere it's problem everywhere but like. comparatively comparatively there are pictures. well.. so. you can see difference actually. it's great difference. there great difference. so. this one that. should not pronounce Russian and (er) Russian (er) advertisements often can see different phrases. really vulgar one. like this one.. and these are for example (er) Versace ad. and another one is.. (oh) don't remember which one. and for English suit company yes. so. they are (eh) they are looking bit more tricky. they are not straight. mean straight like straight of course. they are showing different women beautiful women's bodies without phrases
