 our next presenter is  and .. the title of her presentation is different wars the Second World War in the educational standards in Ukraine (er) . twenty ten twenty eighteen   so (er) (er) hello my name is  and (er) I (er) want to present (er) the part of my previous research (er) . it's about (er) as a  (er) topic (er)  I researched (er) the images of the Second World War in textbooks  but (er) the educational standards (er)  of course  are (er) related (er) these (er) the images of the Second World War (er)  so (er) different wars beca= (er) because it's a question like (er) (er) whether (er) they have changed or not (er) through= throughout this period .. (er) so and I (er) want to start with mine meth= metho= methodology or it's better to say the language of description because actually based on (er) several researchers (er) regarding to a cultural memory (em) either (er) Ukrainian (er) (er) (er) both Ukrainian and (er) English (er) papers and works about this topic . so and for this particular topic  we need to to (erm) terms of (name of the researcher) (er) as this researcher (er) is working on cultural memory and models of memory in the contemporary war and there are two models of (er).. collective remembering (er) because it's (erm) it's stated that (er) memor= (er)  that society has a collective memory and kind of special frameworks which (er) (er) which construct some (er) memory of society so there are two models of remembering so (er) remember it by itself I'm forgetting . and there are two types of (er) remembering by the coherent   there are not (er) pure active remembering or pure (er) (er) passive rem=(er) remembering (er) so active remembrance of the societies  (er) (er) because and we have (er) the proper translation in Russia because also (er) canon  is about what we should learn for example  in our te= from our textbooks official  what you should learn from our literature (er) whoâ€™s specifically is (er) described in our textbooks  in our you know museums and so on and archive is about what we should preserve and keep (er) in special institutions for example  it's something that is available for specialists like historians (er) and these events and this (erm) part of history (er) doesn't (er) exist in society  but only in scientific (er) institutions . so and the particularly . and the particular point is that I (er) I researched (er) some standards. four standards and they regarding to (er) the national exams so they (er) constitute what (er) Ukrainian contemporary Ukrainian schoolboys and schoolgirls should know when they passed (er) when they (er) have an exam .(er) in the end of their education (erm) in school as as we have in Russia .. (er) so in their whe= (er) there are four standards (er) so we (er) (er) have gone through step-by-step through them (er) . so twenty (er) . so (er) the first standards is (er) was was written (er) in twenty (er) ten (er) .. so there (er) we can we can't (er) (er) so there is no requirements (er) for for Holocaust knowledge and understanding of the Ukraine Polish conflict is that very essential because Ukraine and Polish conflict inside the Second World War is still controversial and very (er) (er) discussable point (er) was for Polish and for Ukrainian society (er) . second point is that there are abandons of victim so it's rather victim .  a narrative (er) rather he= he= (em) (erm) .. like the narrative of vic= victims . (er) first of all and there are also is pan= pantheon of heroes (er)  for the state and image can be called  due to the use of the soviet cliches there is a lot of them (er) so (er) we can say that (er) .. for example the inclusion of western Ukraine in nineteen thirty nine but actually that the USSR and German (er) divided Poland not (er) Ukraine there is no Ukraine before I mean like there was a part of  in (erm) (er)  the part of Poland . the se= the second example is contribution of the Ukrainian people to the victory of a nazi it's quite common (er) cliche for soviet narratives in the Ukraine and Belarus too in our text books either (er) so (er) moving to the second  (er) it was written in twenty fourteen (er) we can see that there is a new topic which appears in these standards is topic of Holocaust (er) I think that's probably because (er)  you know like the cause (er) remembrance of the Second World War in contemporary Europe is concentrating on Holocaust topic (er) so and we can see (erm) (er) but we can't see the participation of (er) Ukrainian nationalists for example in (er) Holocaust but you see just a kinda  of this event and we we can see those persons Ukrainians who (er) sacrifice their lives or just (er) tried to help (er) Jews  of Ukraine .. so the second is deportation of Crimean Tatars I can strongly (er) I can strongly I can strongly related with political situation because .. you know .. interfered (er) just in this year so it's required to know more dates and demands regarding to  and as a anti military events on the territory of Ukraine during the Second World War here I don't have actual explanation of this . about (er)  standards we we can see that there is more requirements of dates and particularly events (er) (er) of the Second World War so the third standard is (er) what was written in (er) after two years and just after two years is quite small period I would say so and again (erm) observes there is (er) this role from the soviet narrative just (er) very strong shift from the soviet narrative to national one (er) so we we still ha= have some soviet heroes and Ukrainian soviet partisans (er) also so (er) now invasion (er) we have such terms as reinvasion of the Red Army I mean to the (er) to the eastern parts of Poland or as as it was called .. western parts of Ukraine so we we have a term of exclusion of the German invaders from Ukraine .. (er) also is there is there is Ukrainian Polish conflict but there's no (er) in comparing (er) comparing with Pola= Polish narrative about this war I would say that in textbooks there a lot of (er) points of view you know that there is (er) Polish (er) historians (er) which opinion is presenting (er) the textbooks there is (er) some Ukrainian historians which are also represented in the textbooks (er) is  good but deserves still now explanation of the conflict I mean like  kinda justification . (er) of the conflict (er) . because (er) of Polish (er) memories considering on that it was genocide of the Polish . and Polish side doe= does not suggest it like war but actually there was (er) a war and there is still a controversial (er) discussion about that (er) . so the ne= so the last one is national narrative is expand expending here and victimization is even intensifying . (er) so the  like into con= like the conclusion of this  is the kind of memory of the Second World War was actually great and  and now the Second World War could not be interpreted as patriotic anymore Stalinizm was equated with nazism (er) nazism (er) at least in nineteen thirty nine and the tactics of scorched land so (er) there we can see the tendence which (er) obviously as the most of Eastern Europe country Eastern European countries (er) have now it's a narrative of two occupation . two occupations from nazis nazi (er) Germany and from the soviet (er) from the soviet Union (er) so and the the last standard was written also only just two years after the the previous one and we can there's no just (em) such a shift (er) . I mean like very dramatic shift from the previous one but (er) yes we can see continuation of the same trends (er) and even deepen . knowledge about the war (er) I mean like there is a requirement of (er) learning by heart more dates more names and (er) new terms appeared (er) like I  concentration camps (er)  .  but I I should (er) say that (er)  (er) appeared in textbooks before there is a term of (er) of (er) population of Kiev and (er) surroundings of Kiev that (er) (er) we were sent to the front without (er) proper equi= equipment (er) and there was a lot of there was high percent of died persons and there is a point (er) that the  the contemporary Ukraine (er) . (er). want to remember about kind of one of the crimes of soviet regime . and (er) Ukrainian liberation movement is also expanding as a narrative in the standard (er) . and there are a lot of (er) personalities  so a lot of own personalities  and poor  representatives of the Ukraine nation in the most important political events it's quite interesting because for example (er) (er) those (er) as those fighters are diplomats who took parts in (er) . for example in raising a flag over the Rei= Reichstag or signing (erm) .. the peace (er) document with Japan (er) or (er)  who who organized (er) partisans in France so there are  in the national  (er) their in textbooks there are a lot of references to those people who (er) give a take (er) to= took a part in the war around the world .  in the soviet Union . so in conclusion I would say that (er) . so obviously there is a great shift from the soviet national narrative with some details of I know can I say that  pan-European approach this I mean (erm) Holocaust (er) first of all just a memory of war within eight years and the rapid change of the canon (er) so (er) we have seen it it's also it has changed and some  from the archives there I mean for example (er) when (er) in (er) twenty fourteen there (er) put off the topic of deportation of Crimean Tatars (er) for example yeah so (er) I ready to answer answer your questions   any questions from the audience       (er) should I  (er) .. should I operate with (er) the terms of Sandarts or give my opinion    scientific please     your opinion   I would rather stay on scientific   terms   terms yeah . (er) though I think the as every nation  so they try to (er) try to create their own narrative of course  any country (er) pass through that and . I think that ... (er) in the terms of narrative it seems a very coherent I mean like now there before I started to research this (er) topic I think that (er) I thought that (er) what do they have like I know like because we didn't (er) . (er) learn it at schools  for example but actually they have some topic.that can arise from the archives to . to (er) create to rise this coherent history of the Ukrainian nation nation .. maybe  Belarus have has not a lot of such stuff because because .. just the= ther= their international light was died in seventeenth century I think yes in the eighteenth century but .. (erm) thatâ€™s it  (er) what do the Ukrainian historians (er) . (er) make we make more science or more ideology now   so actually of course it depends on institutions or on scientists for example (erm) I based on (er) some scientists who actually Ukrainian  Ukrainian  working in Berlin University or in Canada or in the US (er) and of course there like in Russia maybe in every country there . there are (er)  historians I don't know how to say like different groups of course for example who works who were for example intonational instead of memory yeah (er) so there are a lot of of course historians who wrote those books and a lot of them had a lot of soviet past example and (er) there is one Ukraine historian (er)  (er) he wrote (er) his work about historians and their opinions about soviet past too and they're so crucial moments that some of them (er) change their position through the political fluctu= fluctuations  ..  can I ask a question .  to what extent is this research biased   to what extent   (mhm) .. I can paraphrase      what are the limitations of this research . (mhm) yes in ok         (er) so probably there is (er) . it depends .  ok so as I studied textbooks first of all of course if we are studying memory of the society es so this position of looking through textbooks and  give us gives us this understanding of what country what Ukraine (er) how Ukraine how does Ukraine (er) sees the politics of memory in their country but it (er) is not limited by because out of schools and there more freedom in schools for example some schools can (er) use another textbooks or (er) for example textbooks which were written by (er) nongovernmental into your textbooks will help here (er) and I  there limitation is this because of course . we should ask for that point of view (er) people (er) teachers and (er) school school children . about their memory and their social frameworks of historical frameworks of memory .. itâ€™s also possible to to research (er) by this by politics of memory through standards and textbook and I wanna also point that there are a lot of textbooks compared to Russian case cause for example for tenth grade there is there six textbooks only for  six text books for international history and six and 4  about (er) . (er) about inter= (er) .. I donâ€™t know like the connection of  and international history too so I havenâ€™t (er) looked through all of them but thatâ€™s why I shou= I wanna to constrain myself on standards   thank you very much thank you very much for the wonderful presentation
