so name and you can see today's culture constant movement new directions trends and ideas they appear everyday and this research examines the our state cultural the context postmodernism and how works how works art are perceived and interpreted modern school children and is specially interesting given the fact that here have lot participants that are actually high schoolers so maybe later will talk about this topic but first all what postmodernism it cultural paradigm that has some characteristics features including pluralism ideas the gaming elements that means that you not only follow the plot but the plot kind follows you the next thing postmodernism kind mixing point for all genres includes intertextuality and also includes rejection all traditional forms narration and what considered be the most important thing interpretation and freedom full freedom interpretation (eh) at the moment the school system (eh) the education have the traditional system education yeah meaning that usually students they read something then they have understand the meaning of something usual is book and then they have find the main idea this long list long established ideas necessary for the development person and for his moral standards and on but it's pretty monotonous topics love generation gap and relations and on and forth you can see I'm sure you have heard about all this and giving the fact that usually the works that discussed the lessons are classical and they follow the same patterns and the same rules decided that would interesting see how students would react an unusual work for and whether they are able go beyond the generally accepted topics when they when they are given such opportunity (eh) to study the issue perception and interpretation chosed the video this house has people it from channel Adult Swim and this video made cuts video recordings from very ordinary first glance family but did exception that see their Elvis daughter who lying the kitchen floor and who facing down during this time lot things are happening for example there their son getting ready experience his birthday party and their grandmother watching television and does not really pay attention the smallest kid the next thing that happening the parents are trying pick the girl from the floor but is impossible because she kind glued the ground and you can see she kind sinking into the floor and the end the video everyone who was near this house was glued the floor understand your reactions and for it was the same understood nothing decided investigate and found lot interesting things but unfortunately not have time discussed them if you (eh) remember ask about this later can discuss but (eh) despite large (eh) number topics covered consider the most important topic this video be interpretation and perception this house has people it being work the postmodern era does not give clear understanding which problem central leaving the audience solve themselves that why find this video useful and very interesting for our research we decided ask fourty six high school students went just ordinary (eh) Perm school number ninety three and asked this people (eh) couple questions we asked them watch this video and then respond our questionnaire (eh) but you can see six questions going focusing three them because find them the most informative first thing do you think that your educational institution the more emphasis put trying understand what the author meant the work on your interpretation an artwork (eh) thirty two out fourty six children responded that their (eh) educational institution pays attention both the author's point view and their own interpretation they believe that order fully understand the work you need learn how recognize the meaning that the author implied and this way can learn something new about things that they can leave through and the meaning gives idea the situation that they have never faced therefore they get new experience but some students felt important say that their school still pays more attention the author's idea they would like share their own opinion and one person expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that the school programme was written the USSR just like the words that teachers say there nothing new and fresh schools which great opinion (em) so the next question ... (em) mean the great opinion just because they are free say their opinion (eh) what the meaning the video was the next questioning can you please name any social and philosophical problems (eh) here can see the most informative (eh) question (eh) here you can see twenty eight people think that the most important idea this video family relationships and that including indifference parent and children the problem generation gap behaviour work loved ones (eh) four students highlighted the problem self-control and behaviour unusual situations for example different critical situations people behave differently and the real essence person revealed (eh) and for unpopular opinions here can three people responded the first one inevitably death are all mortal and will underground which very great opinion and like lot I've never thought about the next one inability explain supernatural phenomenon and the last one people's attitude incomprehensible which pretty close the point this research (eh) such limited choices video topics tell that children choose the most traditional idea the problem relationships the family and the traditional structure school curriculum have left such powerful influence them that giving the freedom for interpretation children usually not use and this that possible improvement lies adding the artworks more open playful pluralistic and postmodernist nature not only talking about books talk about films and even games (eh) and it's nice it's important know that majority students they not criticise the system but they want improve (eh) however is worth noting that wanting while wanting improve the system students the same time hardly beyond (eh) the frames it that why think that important explain kid the idea importance so called mutual communication with the work art because first all need understand that work arts can only function properly the dialog with the recipient ... and this implies that need loosen the strict frames school subjects and you know lot students are afraid show their own opinions because they afraid get lower grades because they not (eh) kind (em) fit the used frames and usual norms and usual ideas that's why the whole point this research guess (eh) for students become more open their own interpretation not afraid share their (eh) opinions but mostly important the want this videos be linked the actual work that was shown it not just think that about that but there has be linkage the product and work art that all what wanted say thank you for attention and you have any questions will glad answer
 
 thank you are there any such vibrant problem related most us here did understand correctly that (eh) the (eh) survey was held among the children the same school
 
 yes this same school yes was the the children from the tenth and the eleventh grade the same school
 
then does significantly limit your conclusions maybe the explanation just that this school is this way and your conclusions are generalising the school system do not know country the world cetera
 
I understand your question and course research does not really not trying put somewhere and prove that everyone and every school like that judging this fourty eight students but think that general school system pretty much the same not every school like that but general think they follow the same rules and graduated school four years maybe five not really remember already (eh) yeah four and was the same that time and is the same previous year when this survey was conducted can say that is not (em) can not .. (em) ... can not .. like (em) ... imprinted every school but for sure the majority schools
 
again that probably the personal subjective opinion which may not become the basis for the research project right (eh) and another thing that school people not usually have you know cinema studies as subject you present them with the material where actually were not taught handle don't you think that you results would different you presented them for example postmodernist novel
 
I not really think because you can know not know think during history classes during literature classes do not only deal with books and with novels do not only read something else and watch something especially giving fact that now live with youtube (eh) with free access internet kids especially are very open watch the videos and then make conclusions that why not really think that
 
no but mean there are taught do that
 
I think is the same
 
so you think that interpreting novel and interpreting video the same
 
(eh) not the same the aspect the visual things course but the aspect writing down the thoughts about the main idea think is pretty much the same
 
so your results will probably the same you show them the postmodernist sculpture
 
well the sculpture significantly different from (eh) novel film
 
oh come picture and word very different
 
yes well okay this sculpture then yes maybe maybe would kind of the same
 
probably need take specificity the take art here thank you
 
thanks for your talk (em) can mean doing all the time can see think the last pie chart yeah pie chart right was just wondering (em) was an open question name any social philosophical problems
 
yes was open question
 
so (eh) twenty eight students all their owns suggested that the video all about family relationships
 
yes is the actual thing have the table here yes they write something like (eh) family problems problems indifference but the thing that they (eh) all stated the pretty much the same idea yeah
 
and did the participants (em) have mention only one issue could they name number them
 
no did not restrict them any way they wrote anything they wrote everything they wanted write
 
or they wrote what the meaning the video let's talk singular
 
social philosophical problems
 
yes Russian kakoj smisl does not mean
 
singular
 
I can not write kakie smisly think just does not sound
 
no mean the question singular is natural that the answer singular kakoj smisl and you write one meaning when they are restricted that it one thing
 
the numbers the pie chart then they would up the number (em) problems identified and not the number participants one participant could name couple problems both of those problems would reflected this pie chart
 
I mean not really understand the
 
so the total number the total children the number topics
 
the number children yes yes yes but named the aid their responded
 
if they could mention more than one thing where the children who said that the video both about relationships and about not know about death 
 
yes I'm not mistaken yes people who are included this twenty eight people yeah they sometimes also add extra opinion for example like unusual situations and inevitability death yes but just putted like that do not know like that
 
so right maybe more robust protocol could help here because think really that seriously interesting aspect your paper because you take you know bunch children and many them their own without prompt from the outside would come with the other standard interpretation video mean you might really take this something conforms your hypothesis about how school brainwashes whatever the children and then yeah your protocols are better you can think about testing in more let's say (em) principled way right (em) and have some other question yeah and speaking generalisability issue that (em) brought so (em)  you think is well your view you think school specific city specific (eh)  culture specific this phenomenon that you talking about so
 
(em)I guess that is school specific some parts it because recently did not have did not make questionnaire but also working English camper kids and showed them this video and they are all from different schools not from one yeah and actually lot people said me that they are more free their interpretation than just like wouldn't remember you think that really depends the school state because for example kids from Duplex am not mistaken can mistaken but (eh) know this school very free giving their own interpretation the kids that my opinion think depends school
 
so you think that what really matters whether let's call them postmodern works are part the curriculum is all about (em) the style teaching and the pedagogical principles adopted the school what you think really matters here
 
okay understand yeah the name my research connected postmodernism but did not want seem like all want do just recommend postmodernism any way possible think that just depends the fact the broadening the school curriculum like can get fantasy during our literature classes yeah do not have only talk about Kurt Vonnegut and you know but general think just should broader and course teachers have be prepared the fact that now they don't just have this manual the ideas with the correct forms expression they just need give freedom the children

 Thanks
