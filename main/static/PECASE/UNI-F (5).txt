would draw your attention (uh) the description and the analysis the text king James bible and the classification its lexical concepts finally the conclusion the cultural peculiarities this text will (uh) drawn (uh) nowadays cultural linguistics one the developing areas (uh) within the anthropocentric paradigm (uh) its goal to identify the influence (um) the cultures various peoples their language and vice versa the influence their language (eh) the cultures and the historical process provides with many examples intercultural communication (uh) which determines (uh) the development interacting cultures one such examples (uh) can seen (uh) the translation the bible into the English language (uh) the seventeenth century (uh) thus the aim our research to identify identify lingua-cultural peculiarities the king James bible comparison with the Greek original texts (uh) basing the material (uh) the gospel according Mark chapters one and six order achieve the aim the following tasks were set characterize the basic concepts lingua-cultural analysis analyze the culture (uh) context king James bible creation (uh) reveal classify and describe (um) specific cultural units the text and based the data obtained (uh) identify the main lingua-cultural features the text the methods applied were component analysis classification (uh) descriptive and comparative methods (um) well (uh) the theoretical part the research based the works Vladimir Vorobyov (uh) Anna Vershnitska .Elena Aquerina domain investigators the cultural linguistics (uh) and also sir Frederick Jack Camian (uh) Alexy Vinogradov and Tatiana Politaeva the investigators king James bible (um) .the main notion chosed for the analysis the text lexical concept (uh) Vladimir Vorobyov describes (uh) as complex inter (um) level unit which deeper than word its sense (uh) it applies only some cultural connotations the example it can taken from the bible (uh) the (uhm) ..the lexical concept dove not only represents (uh) the bird (uh) in its meaning but also connected with the image the holy spirit the bible therefore the analysis such units the king James bible and their comparison with the same the Greek language (um) the Greek version bible now will allow understand the specifity the bible text (uh) English well the let's start from the bible (uh) is (uh) the sacral text Christians (uh) the gospel according Mark which analyzed (uh) one the four gospels (uh) which are contained the new testament (uh) the bible which was written the beginning the first a millenni (uh) millennium (um) the Greek dialect koini (uh) with (uh) the spreading Christianity the bible (uh) needed translation into (um) national languages and the first the first attempts do partly (um) into the English language (uh) were made the fourteenth century (um) but only after the reformation (uh) there appeared full versions the bible English sixteen four. there were two the most popular translation the bible the Geneva bible (uh) which also known the breeches bible because the translation said (uh) that's when Adam and Eve realized their nakedness they made themselves breaches so-called short trousers (um) and another variant (uh) which more appropriate which more has more exotic style the bishop's bible (uh) but the same time (uh) this translation (um) was much more complicated for ordinary people understand it has very specific (uh) lexis lexic (uh) this way the problem which was raised king James the first Hampton court conference (um) was create the new translation the bible which would (um) which would combine everything the best from the existing versions the bible and (uh) eliminate outdated and inappropriate moments the cultural and historical pictures are reflected the linguistic side this text (uh) the authorized version king James well now let turn the practical aspect the (um) text study the analysis the gospels chapters allowed identify (uh) the main lexical concepts the text they were divided for four groups (uh) the first group and the biggest one the Christian (uh) dogmatic then (uh) the social and everyday concepts (uh) the spatial concepts and emotional ones (uh) the examples them you can see the slide (uh) the biggest group it was said (um) Christian notions and is represented the words Germanic origin (uh) and (uh) the roman (uh) borrowings and (uh) this has double side on the one hand (uh) the translator used (um) the original English roots (um) the words with the (uh) original English roots name god for example god lord holy ghost they are Germanic words but the other hand (uh) some name some other supernatural creatures maybe some words Christian dogmatic such angels demons repentance bap= baptizing and on (um) the (uh) roman loans were used this shows that the notion go god wasn't new for the English culture (uh) and that''s why the translators just didn't invent the new words they used what was before the language and (uh) while Christian terms had equivalents the (uh) culture well in the language that's why they were (uh) taken from the other languages (um) also these (uh) lexeme angel very interesting from the point view translation from Greek (uh) the Greek angelus (uh) literally meaning the messenger (uh) translated angel (uh) when means (uh) spirit and is translated messenger when (uh) means person (uh) this separation the meanings which does not exist the Greek text and the Greek language (uh) depicts (uh) the English (uh) separation the sacral and casual spheres life (um) other differences translation the same word can seen the example (uh) Greek (uh) erimas (uh) which (um) meaning desert three times this word appeared the analyzed chapters and three times was translated different ways (uh) wilderness solitary place deserted place (uh) such diversity synonyms (uh) the attribute elaborated context the bible and develople developed literal language the times Shakespeare Don Johnson and others summarize haven't haven't said that the king James version the bible united high start and the planus the same time the combination native and (uh) world concepts (um) moreover was close the original and expressed (uh) the English understanding the bible the same time (uh) and finally formed the sample the bible translation for the next four hundred years thank you for your attention
