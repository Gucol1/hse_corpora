(eh) the message my research are opinion poll analysis search information and review literature this subject the object our research Russian etiquette and the subjects are the history Russian etiquette and its manifestations the modern etiquette and the and hypothesis that even though some old rules etiquette are still relevant among young people there are also rules that have lost relevance among teenagers due changes society so first search information and found several extent rules etiquette from which (mm) chose five chose five rules etiquette with the more interesting origin first them not put your elbows the table lunch the brief origin this rule that old days tables were long length standing several logs and everyone sitting leans it table risks turn over another reason was saving space and also there version (eh) according which the table was sacred object which was forbidden lean course (eh) the second remove their headwear indoors heads were removed as not bring dirt and dust from the street also removing the headwear may demonstrate the good intentions and (eh) addition there version (mm) according which the the entrance the house everyone turned towards the icons the red corner and took off their heads sign respect forth (eh) let girl through the door first according the first version the woman ancient time went first take the danger that might waiting outside the cave and save male breadwinner and according the second later version the essence the rule was guard the essence (eh) the entrance while the lady was entering and think is more logical and the last not point the finger someone this gesture symbolized short old blade lying the hand and could regarded an invitation duel and also people believed that this this this gesture wizards could curse someone (eh) then have collected some information about which the these selected rules are most popular among teenagers analyze this data and come across some interesting findings according the data can see that the vast majority their survived (eh) are often follow the rule cover your mouth with your hand when yawning remove the heads indoors also rather popular rules rule among teenagers whereas let the girl through the door first observed the least number respondents surprisingly the eleven point six percent not put their elbows the table during meals only slightly lower number respondents not point the finger someone making nine point three percent (eh) can see that the rules etiquette are not equally popular among teenagers low compliance the rule let the girl though the door first and the rule about elbows I think can explained is great need for them now but the problem that some parents reproach teenagers for non-compliance these rules I think that (eh) the best solution for this problem to discuss the positions maybe parents will understand that the etiquette not no giving much attention everyday environment (eh) among teenagers especially these rules are don't have sufficient justification now but teenagers should assess the situation too course conclusion firmly believe that everything changing change changing and (eh) the etiquette too the statistics our opinion poll quite logical etiquette important part our life which has interesting history but which is possible take changes people's lives (eh) understand where some strange and slightly illogical rules came from work can used for general reviewing base the origin Russian etiquette and also for further research researches I must say that hypothesis confirmed the way life and thinking changing and some the traditional rules are beginning be ignored new generations (eh) and this process natural but can reason for generational conflict that's all that want say ...
