 good afternoon dear participants and participants the conference name Now I'm student the today would like introduce you our research chemistry the topic determination mass concentration fluids drinking water potentiometric method nowadays modern society increasingly beginning take care their health with healthy lifestyle and eat healthy food one the most useful and necessary elements for the normal function the human body  characterized deficiency that why most residents have dental diseases and can notice large number dental clinics our city prevent the development these diseases it necessary compensate the lack curing with medication the help properly constructed diet are present the com- common mineral water (uh) quite significant amount well the countries where the contents these elements insufficient drinking water most the daily dose can obtained with water. but does bottled water containing through iron .is possible replace bottled water with water from natural sources? the concentration fluorine the natural water Karelia insufficient for the human body (um) hypothesis has been put forward that there are practically fluorines water from natural sources there are fluorine (um) irons are presented bottled water sufficient quantity therefore (um) the aim the research determining determining and comparing the concentration fluorine irons water samples from natural sources and bottled water the objectives our research you can see the screen (um) the targets the research conducted excuse potential metric method for water samples from natural what what as well samples tap and bottled water (uh) the content fluorine water can determined several methods our research potential method determination fluorine was employed (uh) the screen you can see the chemical division that used our research (uh) this (um) was universal (um) and selective electrode exhilarate electrodes magnetic (uh) magnetic stir (uh) thermometer and well various chemical glassware such volumetric flasks beakers and (uh) this and the potentiometric methods to measure the difference (uh) the electronic force two electrons one them measuring and the other one in the both these electrodes should placed the test solution (uh) determine the concentration in six samples bottled water and samples water from natural sources then (um) construct the deliberation grab and compile the table set an equation with the help which determine the value F from the measured values the potential next the basis F two milligrams per liter conversion table represented the result all our measurements summary table (uh) relying the acquired information can conclude that the bottle water the actual amount fluorine corresponds that indicated the label the water the actual amount fluorine irons several times smaller than the values the label for the water there no indication the content fluorine the label although is presented water regarding the water from natural sources (um) certain situation your involved the top and natural water the settlement which may the result the operation the production factory whose byproducts are fluorines (uh) reach into the environment. however the content the water the limits assumptions from water the contents fluorine bottled water allowable (um) and its values are within regulations and standards our hypo- our hypothesis (uh) was partitioned confirmed the water from natural sources and tap water from practically fluorine irons were detected however fluorine was found water samples from and bottled water based (um) based the research can added that is almost impossible compensate for the lack fluorines the diet with the help only tap bottled water (uh) is not worth that order maintain the normal function the body fluorine intake should not exceed four million per day could recommend consuming more food containing sufficient amount fluorine addition water order provide the necessary daily intake fluorine there's bibliography that used our research thanks for your attention
I have question (uh) (uh) far realized some bottled water the concentration and fluorides was higher than natural resources does mean that the water was used from other resources the it was enriched somehow with fluorides?so (uh) thank you for the question the concentration fluorides were higher the bottled water because (uh) they because they factory that (uh) natural from the water from natural sources (uh) there lack (uh) because (uh) Karelia characterized (uh) lack many (uh) clinical elements and that's why (uh) all natural sources from our region there no fluorides
(um) maybe there are some additives that can add watch ourselves just don't know like powder added my water and become (uh) make have good concentration fluorides is is possible kind to to buy such additives are they available
great idea that didn't hear about that and (uh) think that will great solution for this problem for regions there (uh) lack fluorine and they may and people may stay healthy I think will great solution this powder you said will existe
yeah okay yes thank you well you've included some national wide brands which will sold our region what mean. For example far know the right well have you thought collaboration with other regions just identify because you've got already some results and some findings through analyzing this concentration these bottled water but for example just compare your region and (uh) well the water from your region the natural water from another region from for example from our Perm region Perm Krai well what about thinking about collaboration with other Russian maybe schools universities just expand your database
 first have thought about cooperation with other regions earlier because (uh) know (uh) the water that also (uh) also buy our regions may differs from the water these brands the same brands from the other region because (uh) they they (uh) and because they will it only one region and transport will very difficult think will great plan for future make cooperation with other regions and compare results experience
