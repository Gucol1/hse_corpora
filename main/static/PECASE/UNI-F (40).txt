 now can have way name and I'm student Perm State University and I'm really honored present (er) you our research which called features early English translation the Grand Inquisitor since the beginning the 21st century interest fiction translation has increased significantly since literary translation studies have finally become independent science with common vocabulary and vast scientific methodological base special emphasis placed the studies Dostoevsky`s works perspective other cultures. different cultures. his writings were translated several times and each edition brought something new the literature the target language and gripped readers' attention. the Karamasov Brothers were translated into English seven times and all publications can divided into two groups according the principles the translation used them (eh) and the boundary between them drawn Bachtin's work ‘Problems Dostoevsky Poetics' published nineteen seventy-three the last three translations have been studied number modern scholars but previous translations , and have not been carefully studied given their goal, believe that the study the features the early translation the Grand Inquisitor undoubtedly relevant ... for the research chose the translations and texts created within the framework the theory domestication strategy and perhaps manipulative translation which considers translation process rewriting the original text our research carried out within the framework the theory regular correspondences taking into account the theoretical provisions ... (er) our research methodology based the idea the concept concise importance the idea literature work which expressed means language and manifests itself all levels poetics organizing the semantic space the text in Grand Inquisitor such element macro concept torment, which includes the main concepts all which you may see the screen the study will aimed identifying the translation system the selection the appropriate language equivalents ... (er) since the time (er) presenting research strictly limited find abuse introduce our lexing change table the end our presentation even leave its discussion question (er) part ... (er) the whole the communicative intention the original preserved the analyzed translation the Grand Inquisitor the translations and can classified adequate translations and text that of accurate translation since most fully reflects the content and linguistic form the original accordance (er) with the norms the target language translation implies rewriting tendency that levels the language features the original text this translation carried out within the framework domestication strategy which characterized the desire for clarity the text readers and not the recreation the style the writer this mainly manifest=manifested the translators' attempt simplify the source text from (er) the point view its message and its parts that are incomprehensible her to readers (er) the two early translation notes the Grant Inquisitor have pronounced tendency reduce the emotional inflection the original and single out one semantic concept for each embodiment the subsequent texts ... the results following domestication strategy text are seen quality and quantities cost the translated text compared the original the adopted translation was created mainly with the help transformation tracing and emissions which invasively led literalism the translation and lot literary impact the reader and this quite shame since literary translation has aesthetic impact the reader (er) its main goal however, text Dostoyevsky`s word fully conveyed and ... translation were the features (er) that will become the principles the Manipulative school are clearly visible (er) there are many units inconsistency due the translator's intention convey her concept understanding theology and not Dostoyevsky`s position was the reason for her refusal translate the text after the praise and for the same reason her text filled with series clarifications from the Old Testament distorting the original intention the writer which happens be violation the construct defining elements. said, the simplification the original text cannot make the broadcast worthy being called adequate because omission all difficult perceive (er) information will inevitably lead significant semantic losses and moreover, text one can note text forming tendencies highlighted  translation. which can characterized with unmotivated literary clarifications and omissions can the communicative intention the original distorted form since important part the brother's conversation was not translated translation (er) can see system translation substitutions and (er) the reason for this that retains the expressive reflection the original. consider. sorry for mistake consider the translation the most accurate and equivalent the original seems the translator managed bring Dostoyevsky's style closer the reader and show the differences speech and English language. Dostoyevsky's original rhythm was not fully provided English speaking audience any the analyzed translations the translators prefer reduce the series cognate circumstances with meaning time highlighting only one semantic dominant and break long periods sentences (er) order lighten the text English rhythm. guided their own ideas about the pace Ivan's speech, the translators divided the continuous text (er) the original into several paragraphs. text, such discrepancy occurs seven times, and and the counter text that 15 this example stands for rhythm violation Berman suggests although this concept usually applied poetry can speak the rhyme with existence Dostoyevsky's prose, which can violated translator with callous change word order the leading principle paragraph division was the need separate thoughts from one another and (er) order simplify their perception and split sequences events transforming the text accordance with the laws English prose. the tendency violation linguistic structuring seen the absence adherence the systemic nature original text with abundance complex and compound sentences which includes both the use particular type sentence and the preference for particular tense system which (er) not presented the analyzed translations based the provisions can classify the translations inconsistency adherence the common translation norms ... this was the end my presentation and now I'm here ask your question answer your questions 
 not question just comment but it's very clear you know what you're talking about I would just recommend the future trying slow down some the physical oratory and presentation bit you should have all the confidence the world with the presentation can just hard follow along with the speeches little bit quicker 
 yeah that was really difficult follow (er) the number your ideas I'm not sure that got very correctly all that if formulate the bottom line your presentation (er) will correct going something like translations differ and some translators that better than the others is that your conclusion 
 well yes is conclusions but think that should have the courage (er) ... say that some translations are better than the others and sometimes these difference are based the translation (er) strategies that were applied (er) the times where the translations were made and compared (er) text different translation scholars which happened be manipulative scholar and domestication strategy scholar it's correct say that and the difference between textes and (er) the reason why texts differ are these translating schools 
 want ask you about (er) this aspect rhythm ..that you paid lot attention to. basis what can say that translators violate Dostoyevsky's rhythm ... What his rhythm then 
 well Dostoyevsky's rhythm .. suppose the pinnacle Russian prose and the most (er) common thing that people come with when talking about Dostoyevsky's unique style his rhythm of compound sentences of complex sentences with repetitions and this really creates this impression some kind madness which ..(er) really compulsory .. (er) show translations and perhaps (er) the fact that translators didn't dedicate much attention these aspects the Dostoyevsky's works was the reason why the Dostoyevsky's novels published before nineteen seventy-five didn't make such impression English readers 
 you say all depends the function that the rhythm produces for example what you take madness (er) may perceived differently different language culture and thus the characters must speak differently with different rhythm 
 yes because (er) the rhythm the rhythm way distinguish between characters and between the ideas that the Dostoyevsky embodies those characters and case don't follow his original attention cannot really give this text .. the readers different culture because they just cannot really understand .. because this 
 that's why maybe need change 
 we cannot really change because (er) such things translating norm exists and course cannot classify translation some type behavioral activity where everything predetermined and with room for personal decision-making we simply cannot that ..of course but there are some norms that translators are obliged follow and these norms (er) need..are needed govern their intention a decision-making .. (er) choosing different translation transformations order carry the message the original text 
 took too much with own questions and maybe there's somebody else would like .. ask something 
 have very very short question I hope as far understand your main focus the differences between these translations (er) and still you study early English translations .. this work do they share any features is there anything that distinguishes early English translators this work from later English translators is there something like feature that all these translations share that later translations don't have 
 yes they have and this feature called domestication strategy (er) and some features Manipulative school course the Manipulative school was created (er) nineteen (er) ninety-three believe some forum made University European country but (er) this was just (em) sorry I kinda lost thoughts 
 you attributed Manipulative strategy only one the translators 
 no. all them have some traces this strategy because they (em) tend omit really important (er) parts the text and change the word order and change the meaning the text it and they have this approach translation which leads .. misinterpreting the original text (er) because (er) because they don't really use the quotes from the Bible that Dostoyevsky uses they tend completely ignore the rhythm the characters' speech and all this triggers this Dostoevsky's low ratings the world English literature 
 Again from what remember the last translators you were talking about you said that was actually adequate and working better no I'm mistaken try remember your last table 
 yes translation was the best one from the analyzed translations but from the analyzed translations only (em) course really conveyed this message the original text and he makes lot successful tatlate translating decisions but however sometimes falls within this strive breaking these long periods sentences and (er) rewriting the text that was written Dostoyevsky 
 see (er) that was yeah. big discussion thank you for your presentation (er)
