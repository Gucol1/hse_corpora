the first speaker today. . who is going to talk about the influence. of law. on. of the World Trade Organization.. on. Russian 
hello.. my name. is  . and (em) (er) I demonstrate you my (er) topic of my research. and (er) it is the influence of law of the World Trade Organization on  (er) law over Russian Federation.. (er) so World Trade Organization is one of the biggest (er) organizations in the world. and it is also international and (er) intergovernmental. which (er)  decided (em) to decide the (mm) some issues connected with (er) trade (er) and (er) economic (er) issues and conflicts of (er) state members of (er) these very organizations.. (er) so and there are some important W T O purposes (er) and the first main purpose (er) is (er) to (er) build (er) a liberalized (er) trade union (er) among the (mm) state members of the World Trade organization (er) and the second one is (er) to raise living standards of (er) the Third World countries.. (er) the next one is (er) full employment and constant growth in real income.. (er) and the last (er) is expansion of production (er) and trade in goods and services... so here you can see participants of (eh) the World Trade Organization.. (er) this is almost all countries (er) right now in (er) W T O there are. one hundred and ninety four countries. (er) and as you can see Russia is also a participant of (eh) the World Trade Organization. (er) and.. Russia became. a participant. participant (er) (er) eight years ago. so in (eh) 2012. and it was a very difficult process to become (er) a member of (er) the W T O (er) because (em) there were some (er) disagreements in legal science. (er) legal society (er) when (eh) (mm) it was a discussion (er) to join or not to join (er) the World Trade Organization.. and.. so here you can see some reasons. why we needed this. and why we (er) joined (er) World Trade Organization. the first one is (eh) a special right to use a special mechanism (er) to resolve trade disputes. so in W T O there is a unique (er) (erm) element (er) and it is called (er) dispute settlement body which helps (er) state members to (er) (mm) to solve (er) conflict situation (er) on (er) (mhm) some (mm) different trade (er) topics.. (er) and it is a good opportunity for Russia to use it.. (er) the next reason is (er) stabilization of Russian foreign trade (eh) legislation because one of the (er).. one of the purposes (er) of. (er) World Trade Organization. is to build (er) liberalized. union of (er) the trade. community. and (er) the last reason is (eh) reduction. of import and export duties... so in my research. I analyzed.. and suggestions.. (eh) and suggested (er) some solutions. how to solve (er) problems.. (er) what we have (er) (mm) of functioning and indirection (er) of the W T O with the (em) with our country.. and. the first problem (er) I found (er) was. incomplete. systematization. of Russia (er) Russian legal acts under W T O standards.. so it means (er) that there are. binding principles. in (er) Marrakesh agreements (er) this is a basic agreement on (eh) W T O. (mm) there are. basic agreements (er) which (eh) are not (mhm) (er) in. Russian legislation. so (er) I mean that (er) there are some. laws that break (er) that break (er) W T O legislation. for example. (er) in the federal law (er) number. two hundred twenty five. (er) there is (er) a special. quota of. seventy percent.. of using (er) Russian (er) technical equipment.. (er) when. for example. (mm) a foreign. businessman wants to (mm) build a business in our country.. (er) and this is. (er) also (mm) breaks (eh) the principle. of (eh) Wor= World Trade Organization. because. it (er) (mm) (er) doesn't provide (er) (mm) a way to. build this business.. and I offered in my research that (er) we need to (er) amend this law (er) and to (er) (mm) and to have not a seventy percent quota. but fifty percent (er) because (er) it is (er) (mm) (er) a good way to decide this problem. because (er) twenty percent is (er) twenty percent of the difference. is also  (mm) way to decide this problem. and it can be (mm) real (er) reason why. foreign businessmen (er) can. join. our (mm) economic. situation.. the next problem. con= connected with (er) the economy situation. in our country. and.. it is about the competition between. different industries.. so in. it it was one of the. main disagreements. why (er) (mm) legal society. didn't want (er) (mm) to. join the W T O (er) because (er).. in Russia there are. some weak (er) (mm) industries. for example (mm) machine or. consumer industries (er) and (er) for example (er) Russian Lada. can't. stand (er) Mercedes. or Toyota. (er) and (er) that's why It is a problem.. (er) and. the. probable solution (er) to establish a law (er) which will imply high import tariff and a lower export tariff for (er) these companies... the next problem (er) connected with. the lack of. dispu= (eh) dispute (eh) resolution system. (er) so (er) in the beginning. of my (er) speech. I started to (er) talk about (er) dispute settlement body.. (er) this is a unique body (er) in W T O (er) which (eh) helps (er) which helps (er) state members to (er) solve (er) different trade conflicts between. these state members. and in Russia (er) there isn't. any (mm) commission (er) who will provide (er) (mm) and (er) help to. support (er) this (er) (mm) trade organization.. And that's why (er) I offered... I offered (er) to... oh sorry... I offered (er) I did it late at night. (er) I offered. a special procedure. how to (mm) establish (er) this procedure in Russia.. (er) and (eh) the basic (er) (mm) was (er) a. a. system of German.. (er) and so. th= the main idea. we need. to (er) (mm) establish a special resolution commission. who will (eh) be. representative (eh) of (er) World Trade Organization. and (er) decide our (mm) our. trade conflicts with (er) (er) other countries. in. our. state. and then (er) it will be sent to (mm) Geneva. to World Trade Organization director.. and. the last problem is. very common. (er) so I (mm) also found the problem. when I. made. this research. that. there is (eh) the absence of. codified act of international sources of over W T O law.. (er) so (er) there are. many. many acts (er) (mm) which (er) helps (er) (er) World Trade Organization to. organize (er) (mm) the community. but (er) there isn't any (mm) codified act. so we can find only. Marrakesh agreement. and that's it. (er) and I (er) offered to. create a special (mm) legal. codes (er) (er) which will (er) have (er) some common (er) (mm) for example introductions and (er) regulations (mm) connected with (eh) (mm) trade (er) organizations. but not (er) connected with (er) (mm) with th= wi= with the action. of World Trade Organization... that's it. Thank you for your attention...
thank you very much. ...
Please do not hesitate to ask any questions. ..
well.  thank you very much for your presentation. it was good. confident.. well (em) I'm sure that you know about the W T O. law (er) much more. than I do.. well. I'm got some questions. about your last. purpose (erm) concerning the codified act of international sources.. well (eh) do you mean that. in the W T O law. there are. so many international sources. that we. need to codify them. well. for. (em) well. for a better use. for what.. well. I mean. you told us that there is a Marrakesh agreement.. it's not that big.. well probably we can use this one..
(er) so. I. I mean. that (er) ther= aren't. many (mm)... there aren't many documents (er) (eh) which (eh). help to. understand. the.. the trade purposes. of (er) the World Trade Organization. and the Marrakesh agreement (er) establishes (er) the procedure. of (er) for example (er) (mm). Marrakesh agreement. doesn't (eh) tell anything about (er) how. to. (mm) make a trades (er) liberalized. for example. so I. made some. purposes of World Trade Organization and Marrakesh agreement. doesn't tell us. anything about how to do it. how (er) to. for example. establish it. it in (er) (mm). different (erm) nationalities (er) and (eh) in Marrakesh agreement (er) there is only (mm) the way. how. to.. organize. the organization.. and (er) (mm).. and commissions in different countries.. so and I think that (eh) this information is not enough maybe (er) to build.  (eh) a real (eh) liberalized (er) community in our world (er) in (er) among state (er) members.. and that's why maybe we need to add something. to. Marrakesh agreement or create. new code...
(uhu) (uhu) well (er) I asked this question because it seems that you're talking about the greater codification of. private international law. right..
(mm) no.. (er) I think it's useless. (er) because (eh) wh= why.. don't we (mm) just look at (er) (mm) some acts and (er) have this information (er) but (er) (mm) I'm talking about. that we need to. maybe. establish new rules. and (er) (mm) having. have it in. a common code. that will (er) connect with (er) the trade. not with th=. not with the. (mm) World Trade Organization only...
(uhu)
it's. it's not about (er). some (mhm) how to say. (er) private. rights of. different citizens. not about it.. more about politics.. trade. politics
okay.. thank you
