 all right, then, next speaker (eh) can you share the screen yeah can you hear yes hello name I'm the fifth year student Perm National Research Polytechnic University (eh) I'm gonna tell you about abbreviations translation problem now I'm gonna share screen ... can you see that yes can thanks ... let's start (mhm) since ancient times observations have been convenient tool for avoiding tautology and improving compactness texts (eh) now when there are many different messengers users tend reduce words and correspondence and despite the high tension and researches abbreviation is still one the main problem for translation text especially when (eh) translating scientific technical texts. abbreviation compound word well literal reducing two more words conditional sharpening words letter for example etc the creating abbreviation called abbreviating it's special way word formation aimed sharpening (eh) ... shortening words (eh) especially widespread English European languages such English but Russian it's less popular perhaps this due later appearance to simplify working with abbreviations and tool bankroll associate member .. (eh) eighty eight American Translator Association proposes divide observations into three groups borrowed abbreviations (eh) this (eh) this abbreviations are identical both the target language and the original language many languages have borrowing such DVD SDR OMF email and on the second group abbreviations obtained invertion the order initials some abbreviations (eh) had the same letters the target language the original language but not the same order (eh) this abbreviations like HIV human immunodeficiency virus and vich virus immunodeficita cheloveka. (eh) the third one abbreviations derived from the substitution initials in this group abbreviations are spelled completely differently because the equivalence words produced initials differ from one language another for example United Nations and OON orgranizatsiya obyedinyonih natsiy ... addition believes that every day will face plenty new abbreviation (eh) abbreviations (eh) it's quite easier are just (eh) get used the original one cause (eh) ... (eh) cause Russian speaker will get used to the original one then used waiting some translation the easiest way translate to simply leave them unchanged and that classified them borrowed this approach can lead cluttering the language there are other approaches.. Russian (eh) linguist off believes that the main ways translating abbreviations are transmitting for observation an equivalent Russian abbreviations borrowing abbreviations saving length and spelling transliteration (eh) usually use transliteration when (eh) translate some abbreviations military political blocks various societies and on transcription used for abbreviated names companies (eh) companies which don't have correlative form the target language and the last one of course creation new abbreviation when you (eh) haven't any equivalence target language but ... (mhm) it's not enough know the best techniques make competent translation technical text (eh) one should not forget about dictionaries directories glossaries first the translator should understand what exactly being translated my work based material book Crash Course lessons learned from accidents involving remotely piloted and autonomous aircraft Peter Merlin published NASA in 2015 the information presented the book well the translation made me could very useful for department aircraft engines and for students planing work aviation dynamics and aircraft engine buildings it's most convenient present the results my work the form table which clearly presents the original abbreviations and translations (eh) (eh) the final writing (eh) Russian word and of course translation method this slide can see example transliteration ... it's necessary cause A S L the name certain program it's name plane ... here you can see the examples the already existing Russian equivalents such BMDO PRO and M F Р ..this slide show (eh) the examples creating new abbreviations the field unmanned aviation the United States has been studied much longer than Russia many abbreviations still don't exist Russian and have create new ones (eh) and this one shows how much richer abbreviations the English language ... Russian the abbreviation BPLA used for both A and A even when translating P V the BPLA used when the attribute issledovatel'skiye this example shows the difference the approach creating abbreviations different languages from experience reading technical texts can say that abbreviations are found English texts about one and half even two times more often English and abbreviation can created even it occurs one time for text all translation methods are given according population (eh) of the following conclusions can drawn the most popular way translate English abbreviations into Russian to create new ones that suit Russians much less experience with automatic aircraft compared the United States and result the lack equivalent abbreviations transliteration was used quite often because there are many names projects and programs and less often than authors already existing Russian equivalents were used happens due bigger prevalence abbreviations English so despite the use dictionaries and (eh) consulting specialists .. final translation can hardly called ideal cause words well the absence many equivalents Russian however the resulting card index can very useful for working with English texts the aviation field both for students and for designers thank you for your time (eh) glad answer all your questions. thank you that was interesting aspect your work due the presentation (eh) usual anything participants would like know about new questions from you I was just wondering (eh) what inspired you start this I'm sorry very poor sound (eh) understood what inspired to this work yeah what inspired you start studying this issue (eh) thanks for question (eh) you know after fifth year studying (eh) aircraft engines (eh) really like this specialty I'm future engineer and when studying have face lot scientific and technical (eh) texts connected with aviation and ... you know when are you working with unmanned aircraft (eh) ... it's clear that Russia has much less experience this and you want if you want build something unmanned (eh) some unmanned aircraft Russia you don't have .. invite bicycle you have use the theory made Americans some ... some people who who has studied much longer and you should understand all the theory you should you should know what the abbreviation any other questions yes have question in one the slides your presentation you used (eh) pie chart with (em) various methods translating abbreviation and there are percentages was just wondering what (eh) the sorts text sources from which these percentages are drawn (eh) you know the main source for work was (eh) some theoretical basis taken from book Russian linguist this book called osobennosti perevoda abbreviatur truly interesting and useful and all the rules applied were according this book yeah would probably add that question (eh) wasn't very clear (eh) where the translation appeared from do have officially published translation the book sorry you translated yourself for example you know you have five methods abbreviation translation one them only one them using already existing Russian equivalents .. (eh) the four other (eh) methods were just my freedom but it's course it's not freedom cause you have some (eh) some rules for example you have name political military plaque you should use transliteration you have the name company should use transcription (eh) there no any equivalence course you have use the creation new abbreviation and course (eh) that was who created new abbreviation and understand they are not ideal yes what mean coming back those percentages these are the percentages the methods that you used while translating yes course that's the results your practical translation I'm sorry that wasn't clear yeah yeah yeah what was the question about (mhm) (eh) (eh) to in the mechanism that. just take one many examples that you show are why (eh) how can the basis what can you decide that A S L should translated халсол you know according according you should use (eh) transliteration (eh) when you're translating some names different military and (eh) political blocs some military programs and this (eh) this this like secret program the seventies all right that's that's the name for the program that's why apply this method yes yes then (em) why you call your presentation abbreviations problem well because yeah have the kind words have the methods for that and methods are attached particular kind abbreviation.. what the problem you know it's really big problem (eh) this this presentation limited have limited time and don't have time present all the examples. you know have said about about half the abbreviations were created me and so many abbreviations are don't have equivalents Russian they cannot translated transliteration transcription you should create the meaning them yourself for example have had MARS system this information like that there was difficult translate Russian because this camera system you have many meanings recovery mid-air what does mean mid-air and you should correctly translate all the words and only then calculate (eh) what order should you use transliteration and should you use other methods and one them you should .. only after that you have final abbreviation thank you yeah mean had more less the same question and maybe will just repeat slightly differently (em) there anything that makes translation abbreviations problem that different from the problem translation general and translating terms translating (eh) the vocabulary which doesn't have equivalent another language what so special about translating abbreviations you see as distinct problem I think that the main problem the big prevalence abbreviation English text because Russian have (erm) have poor amount abbreviations compared English technical text .it's about two times more often and they can create abbreviation even it occurs only one time for text and you have find the explanation somewhere it's really difficult was difficult for it was maybe was problem thank you thank you very much (eh) and are then ready give the world the next speaker
