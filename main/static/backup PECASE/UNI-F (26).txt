dear participants. dear jury member let me (erm) thank you. again. for attendance. for. organ= for to organise. this section (em).. current analyze would be dedicated. to (eh) twenty twenty. Constitution amendments.. on (er) January twenty third (erm) President draft of.. Constitution amendments (eh) was. adopted by (eh) state duma of Federal Assembly of Russian Federation. in (er) first reading.. so today we will (mhm) revise some crucial issues.. which is (erm)... which are. listed in (er) this draft and (erm) the= we would. try to prognose. (er) the possible consequences (em) which would.. (erm) which would appear if (erm) this draft would be. adopted.. (eh) here the general plan of. my report that first. would be the general info. on. ways to. alter Russian Constitution. the. second point is to. analyse the (mhm) group of amendments. and (er) the third group would be to analyse the controversial issues. which.. I've. f= found. during the (mm) analysing. the Presidential draft. and.. after that. we're going to discuss some procedural moments.. (erm) as. a general rule. now in current relevant (erm) law situation. in current Constitution we have. three ways to. alter the. Constitution norms.. the first is. simple iteration.. this way. (mhm) could be applied. only for. article sixty five of. Russian Constitution. then.. second way. (erm) I would say the (mhm) the most.. using.. most. (mm)... most applied way (erm) to. alter the Constitution norms is. (er) to adopt amendments. and the second. is. the most radical. the third. I'm sorry is the most radical. is to. revise. all the Constitution text.. (erm) we can apply it only to (mm) chapters one. two. and nine of Russian Constitution.. (erm) as a result of (er) of President. project. President draft amendments. analysed I've.. found out several groups. of alteration. and the first. is dedicated to (erm) rising social guarantees.. (erm) and the two m= two main points of these alteration is equm= (er) equalising. size of minimum wage and (mm) of. subsistence minimum.. and the second is. mandatory. indexation of. (eh) pensions.. the second group. (er) of alteration is dedicated to judicial system. and (mm).. the m= most. radical maybe. alteration. is. (erm).. decreasing number. of. Constitutional. court judges. from nineteen. to.. eleven.. the. second alteration in this group is. (er) giving the.. Federation Council (er) credentials to resign. judges (er) on reason of misconduct. or (em) another reason.. it's the. open list of. basis. of reasons. and (em) I've decided. that there is. (eh) several risks. but the main risk is. (eh) Federal Council. is (er) colle=.. sorry.. collegial body (er) collegial governmental body. so (erm) there is no. procedure to.. makes. to make this decision.. there is no procedure to.. (mhm) no rules. how. what quantity. shou= o= wh=  is needed to. (em) accept to adopt. such decision. and so on.. (erm) the third group is.. of alteration. is. dedicated to. risks of. alteration of international law priority.. currently. we. in according with. part. fourth. for (er) of. fifteenth article of. Russian Constitution. we have. unconditional. priority. of international law.. but (erm) the production of.. article seventy five of President. Presidential draft. (erm) says that.. (er) Russian Federation has powers. not (er) to... a=... sorry (mhm) has powers not to. execute (erm) the. norms of international treaties. which.. are. in con= controversity the national legislation.. (erm) the main risk I see in this norm. (mm) is that (em) it would lead to. revised the Constitution.. (erm) revising the Constitution as I've said before. is. the most radical instrument. to alter the Constitution. and it would lead to. adopt the new Constitution. so the se= separate new act. and to. avoid current Constitution at all. to ban it... (mhm) well (er) we.. came to. basic question of. current study. of current analysis (em) so. what way of alteration would be chosen.. (erm) many questions. many issues. was risen up due to the fact. that. amendments would be.. (eh) in.. would be adopted. in (erh) in (er) whole national voting. in referendum.. so (em) but referendum is. (em) current. legal way to adopt new Constitution. so to revise. not to. adopt an amendments (erm) there as= is a separate way. to. adopt an amendment and (mm). whole population of. Russian Federation. don't take part in this process. so (erh) we have. a reasonable doubt. do we have (er) would we. would. be. chosen an amendment as of. as a main way of alter. the Constitution or we would. revise. (eh) our current Constitution and. adopt a new Constitution... (erm) and. main consequence I've.. noticed.. so (erm) if you let me. I'll make an.. a statement.. a lot of risks. a lot of. (erm) alteration. which would (erm).. adoption of. these amendments. will lead to. (er) the Presidential draft keeps (er) a list. of.. more than. twenty. Federal statute and Federal Constitutional statutes (er) dedicated to... this amendment (er) and they should be. (eh) altered. as a result of. their adoption.. so. it's not. just a simple process. it's not just (erh) way to. alter one document. whole the national legal system of Russia.. would. (erm).. would be. altered significantly. and crucially. extremely. I would say. so. (erm) I'd be. glad to. analyse it. I'd be glad to discuss it with you.right now. thank you
thank you. very much. thank you  any questions from the audience
(er) don't you think that (er) in our country. we just (er) already situation that. national rules are higher than the international rules.and. this. (erm) (mm) (mm) speech of. Putin just will
just will approve it
just establish that this situation so and (mm) that. the article fifteen (er) is just for. for fun. and it's not applicable for right now. don't you think. (eh) so
you've reminded (er) President with (eh) European court on Human rights. when Constitutional court (eh) had. several decisions. dedicated to. this question. and it. (er) declared. that. Russian. Russian Federation. is capable of. not execute. not to execute the decisions of European court on Human rights.. but. on the whole (er) I should say that (em) simple bending of. international law priority. would lead to. (er) isolation again. would lead to. I'd say.. crucial. extremal consequences. so (er) right in the moment I'm incapable of. saying that. it's just (er) simple. declaration. I= (mm) all of us have a lotta. examples. knows a lot of examples. when. (er) the priority of international raw. of. international law. sorry. is true. is obligatory and mandatory.. (mm) but I am totally agree that. there is a. significant. exceptions. of this rule
well. I've got a question. . thank you. very much for your presentation.. well. I've got a question. what are your favourite amendments. that you talked about.. what would hope to. become a law. and become a part of Constitution
we are talking about (er) strictly. draft. strictly Presidential draft (erm) I'd say that. there are several amendments. among this list. that I'm not so negative. as I've. as I've described it.. for example. (er) determined but. Presidential draft. (er) keeps. such. amendments as (er).. requi= a strict requirement to.. (er) people serving in. state and municipal. services. that they shouldn't have. (erm) foreign citizens. that it. that they shouldn't have (erm) any legal base to. live in. another country for a long period.. maybe it would lead to. more loyal serving.. to. our country.. maybe. it would be useful. maybe. it would. (er) deny decrease. the.. corruptional factors. for example
may be.. well and. the last question (erm). was about.. the real reasons for these amendments.. what ar= do you think that. there are some. well. vital. reasons.. in Russian society. that we should amend the Constitution the way that President proposed it
we can.. we are capable of say= uncapable. sorry. of saying (mm) this strictly. but. there's always a doubt. but as for social guarantees for. instance. I. say that. it. would.. the reason to adopt these amendments was.. objective.. so (eh) there were. a lot of trends that. labor pensions was not indexated. so it continuing. and (mhm) the level of life. the economical level of life. has decreased significantly since. twenty thirteenth so. (erm) I'd say (em) a lot of these amendments. was caused by. objective trends. objective situations but.. maybe (erm) as for judicial system alteration. as for rising credential of President. (er) it would. some scientist call it. the signature. norms of. . signature prodicts. signature norms
what do you think about. the situation. around. the. maternal capital.. (er) would it to be possible to. adopt and (eh) what can be the. sources of. such  amount of money
you were late. it was dropped since the january the first.. so we'll se= we will already have. as far as I understand. (er) maternal capital for the. first child. first born child. (em) I guess the reason. of. (eh) this adoption is. much more economical and social. cause.. now (erm) the generation of nineteenth. should be parents. in. current tense. and they were. significant. social.. decreasing in number of population decreasing. (eh) in Russian Federation in nineteenth. so it would lead to decreasing again.. pool.. we gonna have. social pool again. and it's just an instrument (er) for. not to make su= this decrease. such significant. such extremal. I would say. and as for. amount. yeah. it would be.. I guess it would be hard. really hard (erm) in the same time with. making obligatory. to. indexate pension.. so. I'd say our budget should work more effectively.. more and more effectively
I was independent  of the Constitutional court of internal federal law. and the new proposed amendments (eh) show. that they work independently. and self-sufficiently. where .. what do you think that it would change (er) the role (er) of the Constitutional court
today morning I've been talking to associate professor (eh) of (eh) private discipline department of. Moscow Higher School of Economics . and he. suggested me to read his article in the por= in the portal .. and. he talk= he told me a little more things (em). his point of view. in accordance with. suggested articles. is. that one of the highest risks.. to.. bend the principle of. (eh) court independence on the whole.. because (em) in. current Constitution. (er) the questions. the issues of. judges' resigning. are. (mhm) decided. (erh) regulates. by. judicial command. so. judicial command decides who should be resign. and why. should be resigned.. in accordance with Federal Constitutional law. Federal law. and. another. Federal Constitutional law and Federal regulation. on the whole. but. making (erm) open list. th= the first thing that. list of reasons. the. by what President would.. (erm) supply. to Federal Council. to resign. this or that. judge. is open. it's not closed. so. it. would. maybe. in this or that situation. it would cause to.. (mm) misconduct. it would. it would lead to misconduct
