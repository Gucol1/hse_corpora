arisen people began forget about their own safety and it's well known social networks are internal part the life the adolescents that give huge number unlimited opportunities they give (er) they're there adolescents spre= spread too much information about them because they usually doesn't feel any boundaries that's the revelence my research work the problem faced adolescents social networks are not caused danger sites some messengers but the adolescents themselves how much information about them and how they spread their behavior all this can lead some different negative consequences but how can people avoid them (er) many will ask this presysle the propose my research work (er) the purpose identifying the main dangers face faced teenagers social networks and offering alternative solutions these problems accordance with the proposed the following tasks were set comparing the social necklers networks and Facebook the ground their popularity young society identifying the dangers hazards faced adolescents social networks and Facebook and developing certain rules follow for teenagers how behave social networks (er) there were two parts my research work the practical and theoretical part (er) the practical part which survey was addressed both the users Facebook and the users VK six hundred people took part this survey the general survey was compli= compiled Russia for the audience and English for Facebook (er) users the respondents were divided into two groups ten fourteen years old and fifteen twenty years old the survey includes twelve questions the first three which are compulsory and suggested (er) course the answers (er) respondents users VK and Facebook are very different for example the slide the results answers the questions are presented are you active user social network or Facebook the answers there follows the part the which (er) left think (heh) (er) the majority users ninety one per cent answered yes and however the Facebook see only seventy two per cent (er) and almost thirty per cent respondents the Facebook site don't consider themselves find difficult answer the questions whether answers are posting inf= users are posting information about their contacts ninety one per cent respondents from the said that they post out but not all the mentioned (er) which information mentioned information about family relationship friends and work school and only six per cent respondents answered that all this information are their page (er) most users Facebook which are more than half noted that all the information about contacts presented their pages this alarming because information this nature's there very great perform have very great and first pers= personal importance but there are simi= similarities the results users both social networks are not too aware privacy settings section simply not use only forty eight per cents the respondents users VK noted that (er) they use the section privacy settings and the Facebook site are only three thirty five per cents Facebook another method my research work was take software analysis the data that (er) users post out social networks since this survey mainly focused how users insure themselves (er) and their own security data analysis will help to see wha= which aspects are clearly (er) unsafe for teenagers social networks the study was aimed finding out which the main aspects teen information insecurity (mhm) the course the study was found out that the social network is much safer for teenagers that Facebook this due the fact that does not request much information Facebook does both studies social networks adolescents are not aware privacy settings section this confirmed both results the survey and the analysis carried out during the study personal accounts was re= revealed that due the ignorance privacy settings detailed personal information available for all the users both social networks adolescents publish large number personal information such photos videos contacts and other things (er) which means that they all also publish information about their personal lives (er) which really not great (heh) for them this approach the contact the pages fraud with many consequences such theft personal information and even cyber bulling the way Facebook users are more often faced with the identity theft and cyber bulling than users the difference the percentage answer more than thirty percents course this due the fact that adolescents relate the publication of information about themselves social networks social networks the same time can like playground and minefield all depends how user related the conduct social networks therefore it's really important know the basic rules behavior social networks the result my research work booklet which sets out basic rules conduct and how advice yourself the social networks some them perhaps are the most important some them are presented the slide you can see (heh) and probably that's all and I'm ready answer your questions 
your material great but you read like from paper
yes (hehe) I'm little bit nervous
don't it the future who are the responders
the respondents are teenagers from ten eighty years old
country
country it's Russia Ukraine (um) and other CIS countries and the Europe side was England ita= Italy and France
is appropriate ask people from Russia where is the most popular social ne= social network think you should have 
No think you didn't understand the research right I made two surveys like for the users and for the Facebook users now you can see actually made somewhere there it's like for the Facebook users the survey looked like this and for the u= users the survey looked like this they are similar but like translated
so you think there some kind correlation between the age the respondents and the (uh) what you call privacy awareness
yeah there some
like (um) the awareness increases the respondents get older
yes actually there are some differences between the two age groups like the people younger ten fourteen years old are much (mhm) like unsafe this social network world because they not clearly understand how works how lives and how not (em) how be (um) like (heh) sorry (er) how they can avoid some situations like such personal such dangerous situation like personal information theft it's like when someone blocks your page and get all the information you can ever conducted and users VK and Facebook both who are much elder like sixty seventy years old they usually not post lot information but they aren't aware privacy settings much the boy younger
so you think that (um) post the personal information mainly because they are not aware this privacy settings because they just don't care
(uh) usually yeah it's like they are not aware privacy settings they not know so= all the people see this information like when you colle= when you your page Facebook page you can put (um) like graph that this information not open the other person this opened but they just don't know about it
so you know your surveys you've shown that (uh) users Facebook were lot more free with how they post their information lo= lot more sensitive information they flood out did you find some correlation with the software at all Facebook lot more prompting (uh) all this sensitive information
actually yes when you create Facebook page there are like questions about yourself and there are (uh) twice more questions than VK like there are questions about where you live where you work address what your mother's name what your father's name where they work and all that information like VK have what your favorite film what your favorite music and they have lot things and usually happened like three months ago they started post photos and the with geolocation it when VK you can just cancel it
