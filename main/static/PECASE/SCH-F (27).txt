 (eh) thank you thank you very much well dear participants yes it`s okay yes 
 great job why did you choose study British stereotypes instead another country for example 
 I'm studying English school I have learned this language from first grade and I like this language and this country much when decided when was were thinking about what topic choose and what country choose (eh) doesn't didn't take (eh) lot time decide because England that country where there are lot stereotypes I learned and read about stereotypes about other countries but England was that country that take attention more 
 thank you and (eh) question you don't mind (eh) you think (eh) .. how can you explain that some sterotypes like rooted more deeply than the other ones 
 believe that (eh) some sterotypes are more known because people tell them from one another person and due this fact (eh) some stereotypes (eh) are more wisely presented (eh) with between people more people believe them and fact this serious problem because not all stereotypes are true and not all them are great and some them really can spoil the representation the nation 
 sure okay and what stereotypes which stereotypes (eh) did you stick before you started this research 
 (eh) can you 
 mean (eh) were there any stereotypes that you personally believed 
 understand yes I thought that English people (eh) drink tea more often and said earlier was I was shocked that they drink coffee more often but ten years ago they were drinking tea more often this stereotype has became false only ten years ago also I (eh) thought that weather England isn`t such it I said that rains more often (eh) and (eh) about red buses also I thought there are that there are lot them but it for tourists more often
