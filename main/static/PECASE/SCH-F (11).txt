(em) can't understood the world floating pleasures the word means picture therefore (em) the art ukiyo-e (em) reflects the everyday life the period with the culture integration the middle nineteen century Japan opened the doors for foreigners to formals three centuries and the way Japanese works art hit Paris everyone could have great collection Japanese art due its cheapness the Japanese were quite surprised when people from the West became in be interested engravings although for the land the rising Sun engravings were everyday objects not works art the process making engraving very difficult (eh) and mainly three people are involved the artist and engraver and printer the artists made court drawing on rice paper the engraver the cut the board with outlined print from the drawing the printer selected colors and tones and make prints moreover separate board was needed for each color and the board had have different qualities depending their purpose for the impressionism there were not successful that time because the official saloon was very strict about the works that were not subject the basics fine art that why impressionists decided arrange their own exhibition (eh) which was held eighteen seventy four the studio the photographer and art Monet presenting the painting impression the rising Sun German list with lay wanted to ironise about Mane's tiles is felt tone his papers and his name the painting impression very sarcastic way and that how the name the direction was born anyway (em) order understand what was the contribution Japanese art (eh) need analyse several paintings very strong the gallery many things work specified and post the impressionists in the presented (eh) engraving (eh) can (eh) see (eh) that there not clearly expressed (eh) perspective the drawing this due the complicated three step process creating engraving fine art perspective was enormously important that why for Europeans (eh) this feature was quite strange this painting Claude Manet can see the same phenomenon the foreground very close the chair deprived the nature position component parts and the background blurred ... this slide shows the following similarities first the cliffs here and here (em) are depicted superficially without essence depth volume and height secondly the background depicted the significant distance part from the foreground which little unrealistic ... the first paint that catches our eye composition division the painting into three parts the created parts this feature was contract very open before the impressionist we can not similarly talk the (eh) instinctive feature the paintings are full (eh) movement and energy and surprisingly they all resemble but chair (eh) paintings pane however both paintings depict ordinary life that there are religious such things ... summing each would noted there are many similarities between Japanese engraving and impressionism supposed the statement that impressionism would not have period without engraving not correct because impressionists always wanted break the rules the (em) receipt Japanese traditions gave confidence knowing way seeing the impressionist experimented they were inspired the engraving but created something new that makes sufficient life it .. catch moments of happiness and beauty will follow our dreams hypothesis was confirmed Japanese engraving had impact impressionists but still was the distinctive their actions and should not forget about that thank you for your attention


thank you anybody something would like ask question (erm) actually have questions with because are really interested what you not because must ask them comes naturally when you talking about the influence you take (eh) two big phenomena yeah impressionism something can you particularly what exactly (eh) Japanese engravings influenced impressionism


firstly (eh) the main feature the depiction every day life before art the fine arts are always about religion things state things like here the queen then you can see her and (eh) to Japanese engraving impressionists started depict (em) ordinary people their ordinary lives and was (eh) more about life itself than something (eh) unbelievable and not relevant for everyone


then you admit how tradition European nineteen century painting which was large part realist and which depicted lot common people it was very typical European painting itself


(em)... would not say that because (eh) still the majority paintings were (em) held that fine arts (eh) characteristics and (eh) what about the way writing (eh) but depicting (eh) the scenes (eh) impressionists (eh) were working outdoors which was not typical for that time was something like and artist used (eh) ... (eh) paint (eh) (eh) (eh) their studios and


and did Japanese masters paint planer


(eh) yes planer that right


really


no not classical ones but impressionism mean them


I talking about the Japanese


(eh) because is really hard process three people are involved and (eh)


so then that not influencing I mean yeah what talking about depicting nature seen with the naked eye and the open air not the influence from Japanese engravings right


open area not but depicting ordinary people working life yes


yeah okay that what you mentioned so mean your kind (em) argument failed the influence the subject matter paintings what depicted yeah and the another side how they did that 


yeah (eh) meant that ... Japanese engraving had influence impressionism but some internet sources (eh) they write something like impressionism would not ever happen without engraving and wanted say that this not right and impressionism (em) ... (eh) really great style itself that why can not saying this way

thank you
