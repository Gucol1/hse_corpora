so my name is  and as you can see today's culture is constant movement so new directions trends and ideas they appear everyday and this research examines the our state of cultural in the context of postmodernism and . how works how works in art are perceived and interpreted by modern school children and it is specially interesting given the fact that here we have a lot of participants that are actually high schoolers so maybe we later will talk about this topic . but first of all what is postmodernism so it is a cultural paradigm that has some characteristics features including pluralism of ideas the gaming elements that means that you do not only follow the plot but the plot kind of follows you . the next thing is postmodernism is a kind of a mixing point for all of genres it includes intertextuality and also it includes rejection of all of traditional forms of narration and what we considered to be the most important thing is interpretation and freedom full freedom of interpretation .. (eh) so at the moment in the school system . (eh) of the education we have the traditional system of education yeah meaning that usually students they read something then they have to understand the meaning of something usual it is a book and then they have to find the main idea this long list of long established ideas is necessary for the development of person and for his moral standards and so on but it's pretty monotonous so topics of love generation gap and relations and so on and so forth as you can see I'm sure you have heard about all of this . and giving the fact that . usually the works that I discussed in the lessons are classical and they follow the same patterns and the same rules we decided that it would be interesting to see . how students would react to an unusual work for it and whether they are able to go beyond the generally accepted topics when they when they are given such an opportunity . (eh) so to study the issue of perception and interpretation we chosed the video this house has people in it . from channel Adult Swim and this video is made of cuts of video recordings from very ordinary at first glance family but we did exception that we see their Elvis daughter who is lying at the kitchen floor and who is facing down during this time lot of things are happening so for example there their son is getting ready to experience his birthday party and their grandmother is watching television and does not really pay attention to the smallest kid .. the next thing that is happening the parents are trying to pick up the girl from the floor but it is impossible because she is kind of glued to the ground and as you can see she is kind of sinking into the floor and at the end of the video everyone who was near this house was glued to the floor so I understand your reactions and for me it was the same I understood nothing so I decided to investigate and I found lot of interesting things but unfortunately I do not have time to discussed them so if you (eh) remember to ask me about this later we can discuss it but (eh) despite a large (eh) .. number of topics covered we consider the most important topic of this video to be interpretation and perception this house has people in it being a work of the postmodern era does not give a clear understanding which problem is central leaving the audience to solve it themselves . that is why we find this video useful and . very interesting for our research . so we decided to ask fourty six high school students we went to just an ordinary (eh) Perm school number ninety three and asked this people (eh) a couple of questions so we asked them to watch this video and then to respond to our questionnaire (eh) .. but you can see six questions I am going to focusing on three of them because we find them the most informative so first thing is do you think that in your educational institution the more emphasis is put on trying understand what the author meant in the work or on your interpretation of an artwork (eh) thirty two out of fourty six children responded that their (eh) educational institution pays attention to both the author's point of view and their own interpretation they believe that in order to fully understand the work you need to learn how to recognize the meaning that the author implied and this way we can learn something new about things that they can leave through and the meaning gives an idea of the situation that they have never faced therefore they get new experience .. but some students felt important to say that their school still pays more attention to the author's idea or they would like to share their own opinion and one person expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that the school programme was written in the USSR just like the words that teachers say there is nothing new and fresh in schools which is a great opinion (em) .. so the next question ... (em) I mean the great opinion just because they are free to say their opinion (eh) what is the meaning of the video was the next questioning can you please name any social and philosophical problems . (eh) so here we can see the most informative (eh) .. question (eh) here as you can see twenty eight people think that the most important idea of this video is family relationships and that including indifference parent and children the problem of generation gap so behaviour to work loved ones (eh) four students highlighted the problem of self-control and behaviour in unusual situations for example in different critical situations people behave differently and the real essence of a person is revealed (eh) and as for unpopular opinions here we can three people responded the first one inevitably of death we are all mortal and we will go underground which is a very great opinion and I like it a lot I've never thought about it the next one is inability to explain supernatural phenomenon and the last one people's attitude to incomprehensible which is pretty close to the . point of this research so . (eh) such limited choices of video topics tell us that children choose the most traditional idea the problem of relationships in the family and the traditional structure of school curriculum have left such of powerful influence on them that giving the freedom for interpretation children usually do not use it . and this is that possible improvement lies in adding the artworks of a more open playful pluralistic and postmodernist nature I am not only talking about books I talk about films and even games . (eh) and it's nice to it's important to know that majority of students they do not criticise the system but they want to improve it (eh) however it is worth noting that wanting while wanting to improve the system students at the same time hardly go beyond (eh) the frames of it that is why we think that is important to explain to a kid the idea of importance of so called mutual communication with the work of art because first of all we need to understand that work of arts can only function properly in the dialog with the recipient ... and this implies that we need to loosen the strict frames of school subjects and you know a lot of students are afraid to show their own opinions because they afraid to get lower grades because they do not (eh) kind of (em) fit in the used frames and usual norms and usual ideas . that's why the whole point of this research I guess is (eh) for students to . become more open to their own interpretation not be afraid to share their (eh) opinions but mostly important the I want this videos to be linked to the actual work that was shown so it is not just I think that is about that but there has to be linkage to the product and work of art that is all what I wanted to say thank you for attention and you have any questions I will be glad to answer
 
 thank you  are there any . such a vibrant problem related to most of us here . did I understand correctly that (eh) the (eh) survey was held in among the children of the same school
 
 yes this is same school yes it was the the children from the tenth and the eleventh grade of the same school
 
then does it significantly limit your conclusions so maybe the explanation is just that in this school it is this way and your conclusions are generalising .. the school system of I do not know country the world et cetera
 
I understand your question and of course my research does not really I am not trying to put it somewhere and prove that everyone and every school is like that judging by this fourty eight students but I think that in general school system is pretty much the same not every school is like that but in general I think they follow the same rules and I graduated school four years or maybe five I do not really remember already (eh) yeah four and it was the same that time and it is the same previous year when this survey was conducted so I can say that it is not (em) . it can not be .. (em) ... it can not be .. like (em) ... imprinted on every school but for sure on the majority of schools
 
again that is probably the personal subjective opinion which may not become the basis for the research project right (eh) and another thing is that at school people do not usually have you know cinema studies .. as a subject so you present them with the material where actually were not taught to handle .. don't you think that you results would be different if you presented them for example postmodernist novel
 
I do not really think so because as you can know I do not know I think during history classes during literature classes we do not only deal with books and with novels we do not only read something else and watch something especially giving a fact that now we live with youtube (eh) with free access to internet kids especially are very open to watch the videos and then make conclusions that is why I do not really think that
 
no but I mean there are no taught to do that
 
I think it is the same
 
so you think that interpreting a novel and interpreting a video is the same
 
(eh) not the same in the aspect of the visual things of course but in the aspect of writing down the thoughts about the main idea I think it is pretty much the same
 
so your results will be probably the same if you show them the postmodernist sculpture
 
well the sculpture is significantly different from (eh) novel of film
 
oh come a picture and a word very different
 
yes well okay this sculpture then yes maybe maybe it would be kind of the same
 
probably we need to take a specificity of the  take of art here thank you
 
thanks for your talk (em) can we I mean I am doing it all of the time can we see I think the last pie chart oh yeah pie chart right I was just wondering (em) was it an open question name any social or philosophical problems
 
yes it was an open question
 
so (eh) . twenty eight students all their owns suggested that the video is all about family relationships
 
yes it is the actual thing I have the table here yes they write something like (eh) family problems problems of indifference but it the thing is that they (eh) all stated the pretty much the same idea yeah
 
and did the participants (em) have to mention only one issue or could they name a number of them
 
no no I did not restrict them in any way they wrote anything they wrote everything as they wanted to write
 
or they wrote is what is the meaning of the video so let's a talk to singular
 
social philosophical problems
 
yes in Russian kakoj smisl it does not mean
 
singular
 
I can not write kakie smisly I think it just does not sound
 
no I mean if the question is singular it is natural that the answer is singular so kakoj smisl and you write one meaning . when they are restricted in that so it is one thing
 
the numbers in the pie chart then they would at up to the number of (em) problems identified and not to the number of participants if one participant could name a couple of problems both of those problems would be reflected in this pie chart
 
I mean I do not really understand the
 
so if the total number is the total of children or the number of topics
 
the number of children yes yes yes but named the aid their responded
 
if they could mention more than one thing so where the children who said that the video is both about relationships and about I do not know about death 
 
yes if I'm not mistaken yes so people who are included in this twenty eight people yeah they sometimes also add extra opinion for example like unusual situations and inevitability of death yes but I just putted like that so I do not know  like that
 
so right maybe a more robust protocol could help here because I think really that is seriously interesting aspect of your paper because if you take you know a bunch of children and so many of them on their own without a prompt from the outside would come up with the other standard interpretation of a video I mean you might really take at this something conforms your hypothesis about how school brainwashes or whatever the children and then yeah if your protocols are better you can think about testing it in a more let's say (em) . principled way right (em) and .. I have some other question oh yeah and speaking of generalisability an issue that  (em) . brought up so . (em)  do you think it is well in your view do you think it school specific city specific (eh)  culture specific this .. phenomenon that you talking about so
 
(em)I guess that it is school specific in some parts of it because . recently I did not have I did not make a questionnaire but I also working English camper kids and I showed them this video and they are all from different schools not from one yeah and actually a lot of people said to me that they are more free in their interpretation than just like I wouldn't remember as you so I think that really depends on the school state because for example kids from Duplex if I am not mistaken I can be mistaken but (eh) as I know this school is very free at giving their own interpretation to the kids that is my opinion I think it depends on school
 
so do you think that what really matters is whether let's call them postmodern works are part of the curriculum or is it all about (em) the style of teaching and the pedagogical principles adopted at the school what do you think really matters here
 
okay I understand yeah the name of my research is connected to postmodernism but I did not want to seem like all I want to do is just to recommend postmodernism in any way possible no I think that it just depends on the fact of the broadening of the school curriculum like we can get fantasy during our literature classes yeah we do not have only to talk about Kurt Vonnegut and you know but in general I think it just should be broader and of course teachers have to be prepared to the fact that now they don't just have this manual the ideas with the correct forms of expression they just need to give freedom to the children

 Thanks
