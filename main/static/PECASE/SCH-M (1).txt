 ...good afternoon dear colleagues name and I'm student the lyceum number two and want present you research the topic (er) people born slavery the russ=Russian the description (erm) the sixteenth century Russian society Sigismund's von Herberstine's notes is situation his work the title (em) during fifteenth and sixteenth centuries due the age discoveries the European interest other cultures was developing and the second discovery Russia was significant part this process because frequent political and economical contacts various books were published for example (er) treaties (erm) travel accounts diplomatic reports (er) regarding the image Russia has big impact stereotypes international relations and (er) the history politics want study the basis it the European descriptions were focused three main questions three main topics religion civility the level civilization and the system government addition the issue slavery was related with all these points was common feature all the descriptions the slavery was degree the lack civility Russia American historian Lanny Wolfe said my study aims examine European concept slavery relation Russian society early modern era (erm) the research object Herberstein's book Notes Muskovy and the subject (em) the concept slavery and the meaning terms which had (erm) have used You can see task the slide (erm) first all want figure out the context the term slave Herberstine's notes understand what situation .is described (erm) secondly would like characterize the phenomena similar Russian slavery for Herberstine for example exemplary slaves his mind and (erm) consequently reconstruct the meaning the main sense (er) the concept describe the main (erm) points Herberstine's notion I've chosen notes about Muskovy (er) the most (er) representative source about (er) (er) the European view Russia was the Habsburgs ambassador Russia and Turkey (er) and after visiting Russia wrote diplomatic report Maximilian the First and later published the Latin edition (er) fifteen forty-nine and the German edition fifteen fifty-seven the second one more detailed more (er) more common author was (em) the authorized translation the book (er) has huge popularity (er) was the ideal description Russia Russian scholar Anna Horoshkevich said my mind is necessary compare both editions understand his concepts better understand differences between two descriptions (erm) the historiography this book huge but don't have textual research yet my task to reconstruct the notion slavery and the (erm) meaning terms which Herberstine used first all analyzed the context (er) the term slave usage first group examples (em) was trying use to describe the legal dependence specific part society the legal slavery which Russia named kholopstvo they could given dowry this example they were people th= specific social status specific legal status (erm) (erm) then compared the status Russian holops German Knecht used this term German edition and Latin service used in Latin (mm) edition (erm) (erm) the sense these (mm) this concepts meaning common knechts sixteens century Austria were the lowest stratum peasantry landless laborers and service legal science where late Roman dependent worker not powerless slave not ancient slave but (erm) dependent (er) man who (mm) have some basics (er) basics rules (er) service equal term Russian (er) term kholop only described not only Russian slave but specific part society (er) secondly (mm) (erm) (mm) focused the metaphorical meaning this term (erm) this context (er) this example you can see used this term not describe for specific parts society but describe (er) the (erm) the (er) dependence metaphorically and emotionally because can't don't know what (erm) (er) what the meaning (mm) the term slave it's metaphor used two linguistic corpora German and Latin qualify the usage legal terms and figures speech learning works German Latin theologians philosophers and historians allows to say that Herberstine used concept slavery express Russian society emotionally not always wrote about specific legal slaves more often about people dependent the Grand Prince Authority (em) also used terms (er) servitus and Dienstbarkeit which means any type dependence this struggle period from capacity addiction slavery it's (er) most used an emotional term taking everything into account would like fo= lay the origins his slavery vision the notion slavery his account (er) uneven there an accurate sociological observation slavery legal condition and figurative description any types dependence knowledge the Roman law (er) has studied Vienna university allows him identify the status Russian slaves correctly they were members the uneven group with the different set rights but his background was Austrian nobleman determines his view the Russian society all types dependence identified slavery there stands image (er) Russian society had significant impact the later accounts but (er) the metaphorical concept slavery was quite simplified (erm) I'd like give context the ideas sixteenth century because think that Herberstine was part humanist movement but (er) his concept was quite unique for this period (er) Juan Sep√∫lveda Spanish philosopher (erm) who written the concept barbarians wrote that slavery natural and necessary conditions for uneducated but barbarians because they couldn't they couldn't live (er) without (er) without authority the power and Martin Luther German (er) theologian (er) while (er) was translating (er) the (er) Latin Biblia into German translated all types dependence one term knechtschaft and (er) for him there are were difference between the types addiction the type dependence but for Herberstine's for Herberstine slavery unnatural even uneducated societies stops the development for that society if all people are slaves the society hasn't development want emphasize that (er) (erm) Herberstine (er) my view wouldn't (er) (er) haven't tried blacken the culture unfamiliar him the contrary his attempt understand its specifies came across incomprehensible for him phenomenon slavery they are noted Pavel the grand prince Russia Pavel has the highest aristocracy and the church treatment the population Notes about Musko= Moscow this view my view my view are not collection myths like our Minister Culture Vladimir Medinsky said other Russian historian political pamphlet but the reflection humanist a warning Europeans about the dangers unlimited rule unlimited power the Grand Prince thank you for attention and I'd like answer your questions how you back the slide with the three (erm) and yeah this one how why you think there can such difference their interpretations within the humanist kind the people how can people within that interpret so differently how some can think it's completely natural and some think it's unnatural think depend their background because they were people different cultures Spanish German (erm) but under different different view the world cos one him was philosopher one them was theologian and Herberstine was nobleman was ambassador his career think such differences determine the peculiarities his view their view and their ideas this case are different
Are you sure that meaning the serve the Luther equal serve Grand Duke Herberstine sure (er) isn't equal yeah but Herberstine's account there two semantical lines and Russian is such eas= it's uneven it's incompatible because different types dependence described one term and lose the difference between types dependence yes about Luther and Herberstine (erm) did the same yes yeah one and only one term they use (er) used (erm) (mm) denonte various types dependence yes but the meaning slave I've got is not the same meaning in Herberstine and want I'd like emphasise that german edition Herberstine used term ... which mean any kind dependence while Luther used term knechtschaft which are more comprehensible more (erm) more meaningful think it depends context usage cannot understand for sure think really really thank you very much for presentation thank you very much for coming and presenting
