 Hello name I'm first year history student and the topic my project visual sources illustrating the history Perm the twentieth century the problem representation and use research and I'd like start with the relevance the story year year attract experts attention research subject can seen that Europe and USA there's such strive generate different opinions about documentary photography and its integration into the world science however for example Russia doesn't seem entirely true photographs are still not serious sources due the fact that the attribution sources requires specific skills sometimes there are professionals with the right education even museums and galleries before photographs continue be used solely additions research rather than items worth studying independently perhaps Russian scientists are very conservative this point but there's ongoing discussion and who knows what its outcome can in twenty years at the Perm state archive vast range documentary photographs now digitized and publicly available there are also number photos different thematic websites and social networks ... nevertheless is important mention that all this mostly done for enter= for entertainment purposes since people like the subject thus there might an underlying assumption that documentary photographs are more than just fascinating pictures they have the potential be real and independent scientific sources finally none the experts know uses photographs their research the main source order study the history Perm ... let's move to research sub= research object contains visual illustrations the city from the state archive collection and research subject the use documentary photographs depicting the history Perm science and popular science projects ... The study aimed assessing the research potential all documentary photographs are related the history Perm ... Research procedure ca= includes three steps first the first step providing the overview visual sources identifying the key theoretical and practical aspects covered various kinds research this field secondly conducting analysis the photographs well tracking their history and finally collecting and classifying the major recent projects where photographs come use ... for the data sources (ah) course use visual sources 'cause my case visual sources are various historical photographs from the Perm state archives and other sources some social networks such Vkontakte for example speaking about photographs themselves also study different local projects where the remain these projects (er) it's Perm nineteen seventeen the data the book the public spaces the city nineteen fifties sixties the evolution Perm old Perm the path the metropolis how Perm has been developing ... methodology various methods are applied such collecting information about visual studies and the history photography global scale and locally analysis and synthesis the information gained through the study literature then conducting research based materials from the state and private archives description comparison generalisation and classification the photographs and the selected projects ... speaking about the expected findings firstly seek classify the main photography projects the history Perm for actually two reasons The first reason for that to the first reason just (mm) although these projects are already available the Internet sometimes even Perm citizens themselves may not suspect that these projects exist and the other reason for the classification just simply prove that (em) all these projects mostly were done for entertainment purposes and they are not serious enough for con= for the world science and the second rea= secondly for expected findings I'd like estimate the research potential the photographs the premise that photography goes much farther than just the popularization history ... it's conclusion it's believed that the coming years the world documentary photography will only grow and will attract more attention being used extensive research ... and finally prospects think work might potentially inspire students the even researchers study (er) photographs Perm despite the fact that the expected findings are not expected be groundbreaking let's hope that more people will learn about the projects mentioned above that all wanted tell you thank you for listening and don't hesitate ask any questions I'll more than happy answer thank you 
thank you once again would like welcome questions from the audience first questions about photography questions about Perm ... again once some question comes your mind please feel free yes 
 thank you want (er) ask you about (er) perspective are you going develop this topic your future studies what the perspective your study your research 
 (em) actually partly have said this speaking about perspectives ... but think mean personally should say that I'm just first year history student of course can't it's kind not really can't I'm not I'm not I'm not real scientist can just tell facts and (er) don't have enough knowledge and enough experience come with something big and serious with that as for prospects said that they're not like too groundbreaking and not actually groundbreaking .. just wanted point the problem that photographs are not studied enough and especially Perm because clearly everyone hope everyone sees that photographs have have lot a lot potential for research but nobody can take and something serious conduct serious analysis and make work just wanted point this problem and that all can for now least thank you 
 okey thank you and think is really interesting (er) studies and maybe your project will interesting for some museum Perm 
 hope 
 you can try okey thank you 
 have question you permit (er) you believe that photography digitalization and the feeling nostalgia are actually connected
 yes think yes
 what way how
 my opinion feeling nostalgia can can experienced matter what you can feel nostalgia not just actually holding photographs but looking something your computer screen I'm not sure that they they should separated from each other because feeling you can feel nostalgia from everything that around you and not necessarily just hold photographs and have you just look you can watch film and feel nostalgic about something maybe that you haven't even experienced same with the photographs you might google some the Perm State archives and open any picture you want and then you just feel emotional realizing that all these people actually existed and all these places actually existed don't know nostalgic everywhere 
 thank you for your answer (er) again that's the chance an= ask question
